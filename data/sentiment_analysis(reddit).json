I\u2019d describe it overall as dynamic, with lots of ups and downs. I'm wondering if other people can relate, give advice, or have recs for some other places I should try traveling to! Sorry this ended up so long. \n\nTL;DR - Colombia was a pretty intense trip. I loved the local people and some travelers, the food, and the nature, but found it to be somewhat overwhelming. It wasn't too expensive, but I found myself regretting various bookings or purchases throughout the trip. Wondering if I am not outgoing enough for the country, but overall still had a great time. \n\nAnyways, here are the positives to start:\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nNATURE\n\nEje Cafetero is probably the most beautiful place I\u2019ve seen in my life. Combined with the wildlife in Tayrona and Playa Brava (I highly recommend Playa Brava over San Juan) the outdoors here were just astounding. As a wonderful man in Munich once said to me, \u201cMy heart goes out to \\[insert place\\].\u201d For me that place was Salento. Even if it didn\u2019t have the amazing Valle de Cocora, the rolling hills and tall grass here are things to marvel at and enjoy the serenity in. Extremely happy we spent a decent chunk of time here. Plus, there were tons of beautiful birds to watch.\u00a0\n\nPEOPLE\n\nBoth Colombian people and many of the travelers we met were some of the nicest people I\u2019ve met on a trip. It was easier for me to approach people and start conversations than probably any other place for me except maybe the Camino de Santiago. When I spoke with our hostel hosts in Spanish, they were always patient, kind, and very willing to help me practice. This part of Colombian culture truly stands out. People almost always meet you with a smile and you feel the warmth of the people around you.\u00a0\n\nFOOD\n\nMany people seem to complain about the food, but I actually liked quite a few of the meals we had. It took some time to find the rights spots here and there, but when we did, the freshness and simplicity was great. Lean into eating sopa, lots of juice, and chicharron. The menu del dia was our friend and we could often split one. Plus, the coffee was fantastic, cheap, and didn\u2019t give me jitters. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s what happened (could be a lot of Robusta coffee at the shops back home?).\u00a0\n\nHOSTELS (some of them)\n\nYambolombia in Salento may be my favorite hostel ever. It\u2019s 30 minutes out of town walking, but the atmosphere and tranquility were unmatched. Plus it is cheap, the people are incredibly kind, and you can walk to the coffee fincas very easily from there. The Valle Tayrona hostel was probably the coolest hostel I\u2019ve seen. You\u2019re kinda in a jungle and everything is made of bamboo and it\u2019s eco friendly.\u00a0\n\nMEDELLIN\n\nMedellin again felt somewhat chaotic for me, but I found it to be very cool. An amazing mix of history, cool neighborhoods, and loving people. We stayed near Laureles and I think that was my favorite area to wander. I recommend seeing Comuna 13, doing a walking tour of the Centro, checking out some museums, and just meandering. The Centro felt a bit sketchy at times, but nothing too crazy. Just watch yourself, don't stand in sketchy areas too long, and listen to the locals if they tell you not to hang out somewhere. \n\n**NEGATIVES**\n\nI want to preface this by saying that none of this is a reflection on the country of Colombia or its people, but rather a reflection of my experience and possibly some ill-founded expectations. There\u2019s also a factor of comparison involved. A year ago my partner and I went to Japan where we found nearly everything to be extremely convenient and orderly, which made our trip relaxing but also exciting as we got to focus more on fun rather than figuring things out. I speak some Spanish which helped a ton, but I definitely felt out of control for decent chunks of this trip.\u00a0\n\nWEALTH DISPARITY\n\nThis is just something that felt a little strange, especially in Cartagena and Medell\u00edn. It\u2019s also my first time in a country with this much poverty, so that has an impact. Flying into Cartagena, the first thing we saw was comunas that looked very poor. I felt a bit odd in this very touristy area while knowing this isn\u2019t the reality for most people living there. In Medell\u00edn, people talked about taking cable cars over poor neighborhoods. This could be powerful for understanding, but also could easily go in a very bad direction. These issues aren\u2019t unique to Colombia, but it was new for me. I did appreciate that it seemed like the government of Medell\u00edn was trying to improve many things. I don\u2019t live there so I can\u2019t comment, but that was the revitalization energy expressed in many tours.\u00a0\n\nCARTAGENA\n\nCartagena is a beautiful city (at least the small part that I saw), but it was sadly one of my least favorites cities I\u2019ve visited. It\u2019s extremely touristy, relatively expensive, and very hot. The streets in the walled city are so beautiful, I just wish they would shut some of them down to most traffic. The sidewalks are too small to walk next to someone and it can feel like you have to dodge stuff frequently. There are also constantly people asking you to buy things. I underestimated how much energy this would take out of me. With all that said, Cartagena at 6am when it\u2019s quiet is a beautiful place. Plus, I highly recommend doing a snorkeling tour with the company Diving Planet if you\u2019re willing to pay a bit more than the other Rosario tours. Easily a highlight of the trip for us and we didn\u2019t want a party boat at 9am (or at all really). One last thing, we did a tour that included going to Alquimico and found it to be very overrated. Getseman\u00ed was much cooler IMO.\u00a0\n\nPRICES\n\nColombia is by no means expensive, but I found that the prices of things ranged dramatically and were generally higher than I anticipated. Sometimes you\u2019d have nearly 10x buying power from the US. Other times things would cost the same. Anything with liquor was usually pretty rough. I also found it a bit harder to find quality budget options than in some other countries.\n\nI didn\u2019t fully realize this beforehand, but the frequent need for guides was a major expense. Even free tours asked to tip about the same I was asked in Europe, which I did. It felt like in order to do many of the fun things, you had to be willing to put down more cash than I expected. We wanted to see Barbas Bremen near Filandia but skipped it altogether because you had to have a guide and it was like $40 USD minimum per person from what I saw in about 30 minutes of searching. I get why they do it, but it was frustrating all the same.\n\nColombia was still quite cheap overall, just more expensive than I thought. These things combined to follow what some of our travel buddies often said: \u201cthe money flows like water here.\u201d\n\nNOISE\n\nPeople often said to us that Colombians like things very loud. Idk if that\u2019s universally the case, but it was definitely the experience we had a lot of the time. I don\u2019t necessarily love the near absolute silence of Japan\u2019s transit system, but I didn\u2019t always appreciate people playing music or videos aloud in tight spaces or in transit. Music in restaurants and bars often made it hard to talk with people, I lost my voice a lot, and my partner couldn\u2019t handle the volume period in certain places. This just wore us down over time.\u00a0\n\nSCAMS AND VALUE\n\nIn Cartagena especially, we felt like we were getting *sort of* scammed a lot. Not like \u201coh we paid for a futbol game but they sold our ticket to someone else,\u201d but more like we\u2019d be rushed into a taxi, our shuttle to Santa Marta dropped us at a random spot filled with local taxis, the guide we bought was definitely not worth the price, etc. Much of this could have been remedied with more research, but I found many online guides for Colombia to be either outdated or inaccurate. Get Your Guide seems very hit or miss (even with very good ratings) and generally too expensive, but it was definitely harder for me to figure things out on my own here than other countries. Much of the time when we asked our hostel for help, they would direct us to tours that were just as, if not more expensive than Get Your Guide. If you want a solid online guide, I highly recommend checking out Tom Plan My Trip. It had some of the best info for us the entire journey.\u00a0\n\nTOURISTS VS TRAVELERS\u00a0\n\nThere were a number of people we spent multiple days with and had a good time. Outside of these amazing groups, the tourist scene seemed very party focused. In Cartagena basically every customs booth has signs about illegal sex trafficking and sex tourism. Many people also just want to travel and get drunk, which is fine, but that wasn\u2019t really our vibe. This may have been a big factor in why we didn\u2019t super enjoy Cartagena. We met some great people, but the Viajero hostel was definitely a big party hostel. Being a party hostel is fine, but Hostelworld rankings in Colombia seem a bit skewed towards that style, so atmosphere ratings may need deeper consideration for some travelers. We had better luck later in the trip picking less popular, cheaper hostels (I was sort of kicking myself for not remembering this earlier). \n\nAn annoying side note - Viajero Cartagena was charging 60,000 COP for a pub crawl that very well could have been free if they just allowed people to go and buy drinks on their own. I heard the first stop on the crawl was another Viajero which just feels like another *sort of* scam like I mentioned above. I recommend going to Palenque in Getseman\u00ed for free instead. \n\nIf people wanted to party, I\u2019d hoped there\u2019d be more people who wanted to grab a six pack and go sit on the wall of the walled city or find a place in a park. Then go to a club or bar after. Many people seemed perfectly happy to empty their wallets with watered-down $10 cocktails and overpriced pub crawls.\u00a0Maybe I just picked the wrong hostel :(\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nColombia felt a bit challenging as a couple who has some introverted tendencies. I try to push my comfort zone while traveling and I think I did okay, but the party scene is everywhere. I still feel incredibly lucky to have met the people we did.\u00a0\n\nAt the end of the day, I will remember the people and the nature. I would come back to Colombia, but maybe visit some smaller towns in the pacific or Santander, or maybe try Bogot\u00e1. I can\u2019t tell if Colombian city culture was just too much for me. I tend to take things too seriously so it\u2019s a good challenge for me to step back like this, but I\u2019ve heard so many people rave about the country, I began to wonder if I wasn\u2019t outgoing enough for it. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s something wrong with me or if it just wasn\u2019t the right energy for my personality. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s much I can do about that except continue trying to be open to new experiences.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, thank you Colombia for the wonderful experience.\u00a0I'd probably give the trip a 7.5\/10.","subreddit_name":"travel","title":"My thoughts after two weeks in Colombia","upvote_ratio":0.88,"mentioned_countries":"japan","mentioned_cities":"","date_only":"2025-03-25T00:00:00.000","time_only":"20:08:39","day_of_week":1,"month":3,"year":2025,"is_weekend":0,"weekday_name":"Tuesday","cleaned_caption":"I just spent about 16 days in Colombia with my partner and wanted to get my thoughts out about the trip.

Even free tours asked to tip about the same I was asked in Europe, which I did. It felt like in order to do many of the fun things, you had to be willing to put down more cash than I expected. We wanted to see Barbas Bremen near Filandia but skipped it altogether because you had to have a guide and it was like 40 USD minimum per person from what I saw in about 30 minutes of searching. I get why they do it, but it was frustrating all the same. Colombia was still quite cheap overall, just more expensive than I thought. These things combined to follow what some of our travel buddies often said the money flows like water here. NOISE People often said to us that Colombians like things very loud. Idk if thats universally the case, but it was definitely the experience we had a lot of the time. I dont necessarily love the near absolute silence of Japans transit system, but I didnt always appreciate people playing music or videos aloud in tight spaces or in transit. Music in restaurants and bars often made it hard to talk with people, I lost my voice a lot, and my partner couldnt handle the volume period in certain places. This just wore us down over time. SCAMS AND VALUE In Cartagena especially, we felt like we were getting sort of scammed a lot. Not like oh we paid for a futbol game but they sold our ticket to someone else, but more like wed be rushed into a taxi, our shuttle to Santa Marta dropped us at a random spot filled with local taxis, the guide we bought was definitely not worth the price, etc. Much of this could have been remedied with more research, but I found many online guides for Colombia to be either outdated or inaccurate. Get Your Guide seems very hit or miss even with very good ratings and generally too expensive, but it was definitely harder for me to figure things out on my own here than other countries. Much of the time when we asked our hostel for help, they would direct us to tours that were just as, if not more expensive than Get Your Guide. If you want a solid online guide, I highly recommend checking out Tom Plan My Trip. It had some of the best info for us the entire journey. TOURISTS VS TRAVELERS There were a number of people we spent multiple days with and had a good time. Outside of these amazing groups, the tourist scene seemed very party focused. In Cartagena basically every customs booth has signs about illegal sex trafficking and sex tourism. Many people also just want to travel and get drunk, which is fine, but that wasnt really our vibe. This may have been a big factor in why we didnt super enjoy Cartagena. We met some great people, but the Viajero hostel was definitely a big party hostel. Being a party hostel is fine, but Hostelworld rankings in Colombia seem a bit skewed towards that style, so atmosphere ratings may need deeper consideration for some travelers. We had better luck later in the trip picking less popular, cheaper hostels I was sort of kicking myself for not remembering this earlier. An annoying side note Viajero Cartagena was charging 60,000 COP for a pub crawl that very well could have been free if they just allowed people to go and buy drinks on their own. I heard the first stop on the crawl was another Viajero which just feels like another sort of scam like I mentioned above. I recommend going to Palenque in Getseman\u00ed for free instead. If people wanted to party, Id hoped thered be more people who wanted to grab a six pack and go sit on the wall of the walled city or find a place in a park. Then go to a club or bar after. Many people seemed perfectly happy to empty their wallets with watereddown 10 cocktails and overpriced pub crawls. Maybe I just picked the wrong hostel CONCLUSION Colombia felt a bit challenging as a couple who has some introverted tendencies. I try to push my comfort zone while traveling and I think I did okay, but the party scene is everywhere. I still feel incredibly lucky to have met the people we did. At the end of the day, I will remember the people and the nature. I would come back to Colombia, but maybe visit some smaller towns in the pacific or Santander, or maybe try Bogot\u00e1. I cant tell if Colombian city culture was just too much for me. I tend to take things too seriously so its a good challenge for me to step back like this, but Ive heard so many people rave about the country, I began to wonder if I wasnt outgoing enough for it. Its hard to tell if its something wrong with me or if it just wasnt the right energy for my personality. I dont know if theres much I can do about that except continue trying to be open to new experiences. Anyways, thank you Colombia for the wonderful experience. Id probably give the trip a 7.510.","sentiment_score":0.9998},{"submission_id":"1jjqlfj","author":"Personal-Injury-324","created_utc":"2025-03-25T18:34:07.000Z","month_year":"03-2025","name":"t3_1jjqlfj","num_comments":19,"score":0,"selftext":"Hey!

Id like some feedback from people who dont like crowds, and how they felt with Rome overall. Likewise, people who have visited Abruzzo, how is the that side of the Italian countryside? Im very indecisive, and need some help making this decision!

It expires in a year and I'd figure I'd do a small solo trip before I go to Vietnam. My budget is around 500-700 usd for the week (not including airfare), but if I can go lower that be nice.\n\nI am debating between if I should go to Peru or Colombia. I have some travel experience, my most recent one being in Morocco. I am concerned that I could get mugged\/robbed in Colombia. However, I do have interest in seeing Colombia. If I did Peru, I would do the Amazon rainforest as that is a bucket list of mine but I am unsure how much it would be or which part of the Peruvian Amazon I should visit. I am also unsure if a week is enough for either country.\n\nI am interested in coasts\/islands, but I also like the idea of going into the jungle\/doing the lost city trek (in Colombia). I have interest in seeing the various insects and arthropods, but this necessary. I will assume that this is the only time I will be able to visit South America. I did hear that Leticia, Colombia is close to the Amazon rainforest, but I am unsure how it is compared to the Amazon in Peru.

I am debating between if I should go to Peru or Colombia. I have some travel experience, my most recent one being in Morocco. I am concerned that I could get muggedrobbed in Colombia. However, I do have interest in seeing Colombia. If I did Peru, I would do the Amazon rainforest as that is a bucket list of mine but I am unsure how much it would be or which part of the Peruvian Amazon I should visit. I am also unsure if a week is enough for either country. I am interested in coastsislands, but I also like the idea of going into the jungledoing the lost city trek in Colombia. I have interest in seeing the various insects and arthropods, but this necessary. I will assume that this is the only time I will be able to visit South America.

The Reddit community gave us very valuable tips before going, so we wanted to share some of our life hacks and things to keep in mind for traveling on a budget.\n\nBy traveling on a budget, I don't mean staying in shared rooms in cheap hostels, eating from convenience stores, or taking inconvenient (but cheap) transportation. Hopefully, this post will be very helpful to some of you who are going to one of the above countries soon.\n\n**Quick summary:**\n\n* 29 days in total. Departed on the 18th of February and returned on the 19th of March back home\n* 5 nights in Shanghai\n* 6 nights in Hong Kong\n* 2 nights in Beijing\n* 2 nights in Seoul\n* 12 nights in Japan\n\n**ACCOMMODATION:**\n\nFor a total of 27 nights, we stayed only 6 nights in hotels. 6 nights cost us ca. 180 Euros. For China, we used\u00a0Trip website\u00a0(3 nights, 3 cities, 3 hotels). I would highly encourage you to either avoid using\u00a0Trip whatsoever or to be very careful with the hotel chosen. Almost all of their reviews and pictures are fake.\n\nFor the other 21 nights, we got very lucky by organizing 3 (almost) consecutive exchanges using home exchanges in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Kyoto. I would highly encourage many of you to try the platform. We've been using it for almost 7 years and have stayed in so many different places. Even if we had booked the cheapest options in these three cities, it would have cost us a minimum of \u20ac 1.1K\n\n**TRANSPORT:**\n\n***Flights:***\n\n* There are direct flights from Germany (Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich) to China (our first point of arrival). These however cost at least \u20ac 500-600. Instead, we found direct flights for \u20ac 200 from Budapest, Hungary. We did have to take an additional flight to\/from Budapest. Ongoing, we decided to arrive in Budapest 2 days before so we can also explore the city. For the return flight, we had to wait ca. 6 hours at the Budapest Airport, but in the end, it all worked out. This slight \"inconvenience\" resulted in savings of \u20ac 1.5K (including the additional costs to arrive in Budapest). We booked with\u00a0AirChina and I must admit both flights were very comfortable, with 2 meals per flight provided, and extra amenities.\n* Booking 2-3 months in advance is the ideal timeframe.\n* Also, oftentimes connecting flights are way cheaper than a direct flight. So you might wanna explore such options as well.\n* My first point of reference is ALWAYS skyscanner.com! Instead of checking for a specific city, I do research for the entire country. Once I find the best option, I go and book everything through the original website of the airline company. I NEVER book through intermediaries.\n* Once in Asia, we had 4 additional flights that we booked with SpringAirlines, AirChina, and JejuAir. Overall all ok, you get what you paid for. One very interesting thing about flights in Asia, oftentimes, is that the closer you are to the departure date, the cheaper the price! For example, we booked 3 months in advance Shanghai - Hong Kong with Spring Airlines. Paid ca. \u20ac 180 for both of us. 3 weeks before departing, I checked again, it would've cost us \u20ac 120.\n\n***TRAINS:***\n\n* We used trains only in Japan, more precisely the SHINKANSEN. So many times actually :)\n* Our trip to Japan was in west Japan (the area between Kyoto and Hiroshima). So we made use of the JR West Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass. We paid \u20ac 105 for a 5-day pass between Hiroshima and Kyoto. The Shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima is included in this price. Boy oh boy, we saved so much with this pass. We did: Day 1: Kyoto-Hiroshima, Day 2: Kyoto - Himeji - Kobe, Day 3: Kyoto - Kurashiki - Okayama, Day 4: Kyoto - Takamatsu (Shikoku Island), Day 5: Kyoto - Osaka. If booked individually, it would've cost us at least \u20ac 340 (I stopped calculating at one point). Main takeaway: Make use of the regional JR Passes, instead of the JR pass (it is not worth it at all!).\n\n***METRO:***\n\n* We used almost the whole time the metro. Metro in China is super cheap! Make use of it.\n\n**FOOD & SOUVENIRS:**\n\n* Food in China, was on average, the cheapest. There were days, where we spent ca.\u20ac 30 per day, 3 meals a day, transport including for the both of us. Install AliPay (you will definitely gonna need it). Almost every time, in every restaurant, if you book via AliPay, you will pay less (you get various discounts) compared to paying at the restaurant. The savings are sometimes even 50%! If you download the mini-app Meituan (within AliPay), you can get so many different discounts for food. Unfortunately, our Chinese is pretty bad, so we didn't use it.\n* For Seoul and for Japan, our budget was, on average, \u20ac 40 for both of us. Of course, the main thing we always do (a strict rule we have) is to avoid the touristy area. So we do a quick research on Google as to where to eat.\n* In general, for every country, AVOID restaurants where there is someone outside with a sign targeting customers. A good restaurant doesn't need that.\n\nTraveling doesn't have to be expensive. One just needs the time and dedication to explore the most cost-effective options when traveling. This is our 3rd year in a row visiting Asian countries, and we always organize longer journeys that include several countries. Visiting Japan from China would cost us an additional \u20ac 160 as opposed to taking a flight from Europe.\n\nAs a reference, last year we did a 1-month trip in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand which cost us ca. 3K.\n\nFeel free to dm if you need some advice.","subreddit_name":"travel","title":"1 Month -> China + HK + Macau + Seoul + Japan = \u20ac 3.5K for 2 pax!

For China, we used\u00a0Trip website\u00a0(3 nights, 3 cities, 3 hotels). I would highly encourage you to either avoid using\u00a0Trip whatsoever or to be very careful with the hotel chosen. Almost all of their reviews and pictures are fake.\n\nFor the other 21 nights, we got very lucky by organizing 3 (almost) consecutive exchanges using home exchanges in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Kyoto. I would highly encourage many of you to try the platform. We've been using it for almost 7 years and have stayed in so many different places. Even if we had booked the cheapest options in these three cities, it would have cost us a minimum of \u20ac 1.1K\n\n**TRANSPORT:**\n\n***Flights:***\n\n* There are direct flights from Germany (Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich) to China (our first point of arrival). These however cost at least \u20ac 500-600. Instead, we found direct flights for \u20ac 200 from Budapest, Hungary. We did have to take an additional flight to\/from Budapest. Ongoing, we decided to arrive in Budapest 2 days before so we can also explore the city. For the return flight, we had to wait ca. 6 hours at the Budapest Airport, but in the end, it all worked out. This slight \"inconvenience\" resulted in savings of \u20ac 1.5K (including the additional costs to arrive in Budapest). We booked with\u00a0AirChina and I must admit both flights were very comfortable, with 2 meals per flight provided, and extra amenities.\n* Booking 2-3 months in advance is the ideal timeframe.\n* Also, oftentimes connecting flights are way cheaper than a direct flight. So you might wanna explore such options as well.\n* My first point of reference is ALWAYS skyscanner.com! Instead of checking for a specific city, I do research for the entire country. Once I find the best option, I go and book everything through the original website of the airline company. I NEVER book through intermediaries.\n* Once in Asia, we had 4 additional flights that we booked with SpringAirlines, AirChina, and JejuAir. Overall all ok, you get what you paid for. One very interesting thing about flights in Asia, oftentimes, is that the closer you are to the departure date, the cheaper the price! For example, we booked 3 months in advance Shanghai - Hong Kong with Spring Airlines. Paid ca. \u20ac 180 for both of us. 3 weeks before departing, I checked again, it would've cost us \u20ac 120.\n\n***TRAINS:***\n\n* We used trains only in Japan, more precisely the SHINKANSEN. So many times actually :)\n* Our trip to Japan was in west Japan (the area between Kyoto and Hiroshima). So we made use of the JR West Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass. We paid \u20ac 105 for a 5-day pass between Hiroshima and Kyoto. The Shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima is included in this price. Boy oh boy, we saved so much with this pass. We did: Day 1: Kyoto-Hiroshima, Day 2: Kyoto - Himeji - Kobe, Day 3: Kyoto - Kurashiki - Okayama, Day 4: Kyoto - Takamatsu (Shikoku Island), Day 5: Kyoto - Osaka. If booked individually, it would've cost us at least \u20ac 340 (I stopped calculating at one point). Main takeaway: Make use of the regional JR Passes, instead of the JR pass (it is not worth it at all!).\n\n***METRO:***\n\n* We used almost the whole time the metro. Metro in China is super cheap! Make use of it.\n\n**FOOD & SOUVENIRS:**\n\n* Food in China, was on average, the cheapest. There were days, where we spent ca.\u20ac 30 per day, 3 meals a day, transport including for the both of us. Install AliPay (you will definitely gonna need it). Almost every time, in every restaurant, if you book via AliPay, you will pay less (you get various discounts) compared to paying at the restaurant. The savings are sometimes even 50%! If you download the mini-app Meituan (within AliPay), you can get so many different discounts for food. Unfortunately, our Chinese is pretty bad, so we didn't use it.\n* For Seoul and for Japan, our budget was, on average, \u20ac 40 for both of us. Of course, the main thing we always do (a strict rule we have) is to avoid the touristy area. So we do a quick research on Google as to where to eat.\n* In general, for every country, AVOID restaurants where there is someone outside with a sign targeting customers. A good restaurant doesn't need that.\n\nTraveling doesn't have to be expensive. One just needs the time and dedication to explore the most cost-effective options when traveling.

By traveling on a budget, I dont mean staying in shared rooms in cheap hostels, eating from convenience stores, or taking inconvenient but cheap transportation. Hopefully, this post will be very helpful to some of you who are going to one of the above countries soon. Quick summary 29 days in total. Departed on the 18th of February and returned on the 19th of March back home 5 nights in Shanghai 6 nights in Hong Kong 2 nights in Beijing 2 nights in Seoul 12 nights in Japan ACCOMMODATION For a total of 27 nights, we stayed only 6 nights in hotels. 6 nights cost us ca. 180 Euros. For China, we used Trip website 3 nights, 3 cities, 3 hotels. I would highly encourage you to either avoid using Trip whatsoever or to be very careful with the hotel chosen. Almost all of their reviews and pictures are fake. For the other 21 nights, we got very lucky by organizing 3 almost consecutive exchanges using home exchanges in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Kyoto. I would highly encourage many of you to try the platform. Weve been using it for almost 7 years and have stayed in so many different places. Even if we had booked the cheapest options in these three cities, it would have cost us a minimum of 1.1K TRANSPORT Flights There are direct flights from Germany Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich to China our first point of arrival. These however cost at least 500600. Instead, we found direct flights for 200 from Budapest, Hungary. We did have to take an additional flight tofrom Budapest. Ongoing, we decided to arrive in Budapest 2 days before so we can also explore the city. For the return flight, we had to wait ca. 6 hours at the Budapest Airport, but in the end, it all worked out. This slight inconvenience resulted in savings of 1.5K including the additional costs to arrive in Budapest. We booked with AirChina and I must admit both flights were very comfortable, with 2 meals per flight provided, and extra amenities. Booking 23 months in advance is the ideal timeframe. Also, oftentimes connecting flights are way cheaper than a direct flight. So you might wanna explore such options as well. My first point of reference is ALWAYS skyscanner.com! Instead of checking for a specific city, I do research for the entire country. Once I find the best option, I go and book everything through the original website of the airline company. I NEVER book through intermediaries. Once in Asia, we had 4 additional flights that we booked with SpringAirlines, AirChina, and JejuAir. Overall all ok, you get what you paid for. One very interesting thing about flights in Asia, oftentimes, is that the closer you are to the departure date, the cheaper the price! For example, we booked 3 months in advance Shanghai Hong Kong with Spring Airlines. Paid ca. 180 for both of us. 3 weeks before departing, I checked again, it wouldve cost us 120. TRAINS We used trains only in Japan, more precisely the SHINKANSEN. So many times actually Our trip to Japan was in west Japan the area between Kyoto and Hiroshima. So we made use of the JR West KansaiHiroshima Area Pass. We paid 105 for a 5day pass between Hiroshima and Kyoto. The Shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima is included in this price. Boy oh boy, we saved so much with this pass. We did Day 1 KyotoHiroshima, Day 2 Kyoto Himeji Kobe, Day 3 Kyoto Kurashiki Okayama, Day 4 Kyoto Takamatsu Shikoku Island, Day 5 Kyoto Osaka. If booked individually, it wouldve cost us at least 340 I stopped calculating at one point. Main takeaway Make use of the regional JR Passes, instead of the JR pass it is not worth it at all!. METRO We used almost the whole time the metro. Metro in China is super cheap! Make use of it. FOOD SOUVENIRS Food in China, was on average, the cheapest. There were days, where we spent ca. 30 per day, 3 meals a day, transport including for the both of us. Install AliPay you will definitely gonna need it. Almost every time, in every restaurant, if you book via AliPay, you will pay less you get various discounts compared to paying at the restaurant. The savings are sometimes even 50! If you download the miniapp Meituan within AliPay, you can get so many different discounts for food. Unfortunately, our Chinese is pretty bad, so we didnt use it. For Seoul and for Japan, our budget was, on average, 40 for both of us. Of course, the main thing we always do a strict rule we have is to avoid the touristy area. So we do a quick research on Google as to where to eat. In general, for every country, AVOID restaurants where there is someone outside with a sign targeting customers. A good restaurant doesnt need that. Traveling doesnt have to be expensive. One just needs the time and dedication to explore the most costeffective options when traveling. This is our 3rd year in a row visiting Asian countries, and we always organize longer journeys that include several countries. Visiting Japan from China would cost us an additional 160 as opposed to taking a flight from Europe. As a reference, last year we did a 1month trip in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand which cost us ca. 3K.

I always thought of it as a city of charming high-rises, busy streets and subways, and most importantly the largest financial center ever existed on Earth. As a Finance major, I want to understand the key elements of the economic success of NYC. What has driven the robust financial sector in NYC that allows it to surpass London (another city that is on my bucket list)? I came to see it for myself and as I always say to my friends, the rest is history. It was an epic and otherworldly experience of a lifetime. I know for a fact that NYC is a city with a lot of issues (homelessness, drugs, poor hygiene in certain areas\u2026etc). I got it. But we cannot deny that NYC is a charming, glamorous city in and out of itself. I love the blend of modern skyscrapers with antiquated 2 to 3-story buildings cladded by the brown-ish bricks. These old buildings probably were erected decades if not a century ago, witnessing the development of NYC and its transition towards the position it is sitting at right now. Liberty Island- where the statue of liberty is located, was also part of my adventure. The city is also home to a lot of expats and people of different nationalities. I don\u2019t know for sure but what I can definitely tell is diversity is also what makes NYC stand out amongst its peers in the US. You can get really good burritos or BBQ in Texas but you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to try let\u2019s say, Turkish kebabs or some Eastern European foods. On top of all these things, NYC public transportation is not as appalling as portrayed by the mainstream media. Yes, it is dirty, it is run-down, and it desperately needs the maintenance to be carried out by the MTA. But at the very least, it still covers pretty much the entirety of NYC, allowing you to travel to wherever you want at a fraction of the cost of an Uber ride. As each ride only sets you back $2.90 and you can transfer through stations at no additional cost, it is really budget-friendly for those with a limited amount of money like me. What about navigation? Well, I only have one word to say: \u201cI counted on Google Maps for directions and indeed it was phenomenal. As a Google Map enthusiast, I used to spend hours looking at the satellite image of the cities and as a result, I have gotten the grip of it. It may seem that I was going off on a tangent here but this habit of binging Google Maps really rendered me the prior familiarization with the city I am going to visit. This helps me navigate better within the city which ultimately saves me a lot of time and money. I had already known where to go and what to do before I arrived at the airport. Just to give an exemplary case, I literally saved 50 bucks by virtue of taking two buses while an Uber ride to Laguardia Terminal C would easily cost me 60 bucks. I got to the airport on time for just $5.80. Could you believe that would be possible in NYC? The answer is yes but you need to do your own research and more importantly, be willing to muster up the energy to walk long distances. That way, you can explore every corner, every small alley and see how the locals actually live outside of tourist hotspots. Because you know what, what makes traveling so great is not just about the overhyped or oversaturated areas, it is more about the authentic life of people here and there. It is about enriching your own knowledge and understanding of the world through the lenses of a local. It is about broadening your mind and bringing you new opportunities for growth. \n  I know I have rambled a lot but now it is time for the specific locations that I visited. First of all, I really love the one-world observatory which provides visitors with a panoramic view of the entire city. I could see the Brooklyn Bridge dating back to the late 1800s or all these historical landmarks in Midtown Manhattan like the Empire State Building. The building itself is the tallest skyscraper in the Western hemisphere to have ever existed. Also, I got to try some Chinese foods, specifically Shanghai ones in ChinaTown which were so tangy and flavorful. The dimsum and the pickle noodles were so scrumptious. From the perspective of a backpacker, this was an epic journey, a testament to the knowledge and travel experiences I have accrued for years of binging flight and hotel reviewers. Without the guidance and observation of my parents, I still managed to take care of myself and more importantly, navigate through a sophisticated city such as New York. I was having a whale of a time there and it seems like I couldn\u2019t drag away from such an epic experience. I have a message for New Yorkers out there:\u2019Don\u2019t take things for granted\u2019 and start appreciating what you guys enjoy\u201d. So that just wrapped up my Spring Break trip. I could literally just wimp out and spend the entirety of my breaks on campus doing nothing but I am glad I have attempted and indeed went beyond my comfort zone. It was worth every cent that I spent and I look forward to visiting other US cities in the future.

Yes, it is dirty, it is rundown, and it desperately needs the maintenance to be carried out by the MTA. But at the very least, it still covers pretty much the entirety of NYC, allowing you to travel to wherever you want at a fraction of the cost of an Uber ride. As each ride only sets you back 2.90 and you can transfer through stations at no additional cost, it is really budgetfriendly for those with a limited amount of money like me. What about navigation? Well, I only have one word to say I counted on Google Maps for directions and indeed it was phenomenal. As a Google Map enthusiast, I used to spend hours looking at the satellite image of the cities and as a result, I have gotten the grip of it. It may seem that I was going off on a tangent here but this habit of binging Google Maps really rendered me the prior familiarization with the city I am going to visit. This helps me navigate better within the city which ultimately saves me a lot of time and money. I had already known where to go and what to do before I arrived at the airport. Just to give an exemplary case, I literally saved 50 bucks by virtue of taking two buses while an Uber ride to Laguardia Terminal C would easily cost me 60 bucks. I got to the airport on time for just 5.80. Could you believe that would be possible in NYC? The answer is yes but you need to do your own research and more importantly, be willing to muster up the energy to walk long distances. That way, you can explore every corner, every small alley and see how the locals actually live outside of tourist hotspots. Because you know what, what makes traveling so great is not just about the overhyped or oversaturated areas, it is more about the authentic life of people here and there. It is about enriching your own knowledge and understanding of the world through the lenses of a local. It is about broadening your mind and bringing you new opportunities for growth. I know I have rambled a lot but now it is time for the specific locations that I visited. First of all, I really love the oneworld observatory which provides visitors with a panoramic view of the entire city. I could see the Brooklyn Bridge dating back to the late 1800s or all these historical landmarks in Midtown Manhattan like the Empire State Building. The building itself is the tallest skyscraper in the Western hemisphere to have ever existed. Also, I got to try some Chinese foods, specifically Shanghai ones in ChinaTown which were so tangy and flavorful. The dimsum and the pickle noodles were so scrumptious. From the perspective of a backpacker, this was an epic journey, a testament to the knowledge and travel experiences I have accrued for years of binging flight and hotel reviewers. Without the guidance and observation of my parents, I still managed to take care of myself and more importantly, navigate through a sophisticated city such as New York. I was having a whale of a time there and it seems like I couldnt drag away from such an epic experience. I have a message for New Yorkers out thereDont take things for granted and start appreciating what you guys enjoy. So that just wrapped up my Spring Break trip. I could literally just wimp out and spend the entirety of my breaks on campus doing nothing but I am glad I have attempted and indeed went beyond my comfort zone. It was worth every cent that I spent and I look forward to visiting other US cities in the future. Life is not just all about money, it is about the experiences!!!","sentiment_score":0.9993},{"submission_id":"1ji0dqk","author":"Revolutionary-Two-84","created_utc":"2025-03-23T14:22:52.000Z","month_year":"03-2025","name":"t3_1ji0dqk","num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"Hi all-\n\nGoing to southeast Asia for two weeks in end of July\/beginning of August and trying to figure out where to go.

I'm hyped about it, but **I don't have the time I usually do to calculate every last detail**, so I was hoping to make this a more chill experience by basing myself in Taipei (except for one day in Kaohsiung) and taking bunch of mostly-easy day trips... but here is the itinerary, please rip into it and **feel free to critique anything that doesn't fit.** \n\n**DAY 1**  \nArrive in Taipei in the early afternoon. Immigration, getting to the hostel, and maybe hang out in a creative park\/a literal park. \n\nIf tired, just be at the hostel and get some work done. \n\n**DAY 2**   \nVisit a temple in the morning (Lungshan Temple?)  \nVisit a museum - current main candidates are the Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines or the National Museum. I am aware they are very different in scale, but I quite enjoy smaller museums!\n\n**DAY 3**   \nTrip to Yilan, visit the National Center for Traditional Arts  \nOR   \nTrip to Wulai, explore around --> leaning towards this at the moment\n\n**DAY 4**  \nHead to Kaohsiung in the morning. The schedule here will be very free, but the one thing I definitely want to see is Fo Guang Shan Temple. Mostly, though, I'm meeting a local friend in Kaohsiung, so I'll let them take the lead. Sleep here.   \n  \n**DAY 5**  \nIf anything is still left over to do in Kaohsiung, do it. Otherwise, take the train to Taipei again.  Considering whether the slow train is worth the savings. Not much planned here; I was hoping to stop by in Taichung and take a short walk around the Rainbow Village, because I love colorful places and less museum-y art, but I'm worried it would be too long. \n\n**DAY 6**   \nConsidering whether to do Jiufen and Shifen, even if it's a weekend. On one hand, they look cool and my friend recommended them to me. On the other, they also look very touristy, and will probably be very busy. \n\n**DAY 7**   \nNo solid plans. I will either improvise or ask for advice from people who've been around. I am also considering leaving this as my \"buffer\" day.   \n  \n**Possible variations**: I have considered arriving in Taipei and immediately taking the train to Kaohsiung, but this would depend on my friend's availability, and I'm a little worried that it would be too tiring after waking up in the morning to take a bus to the airport, a flight, and then more trains. \n\nSo please, critique my itinerary! Is there something I should skip? Something I should add? Something else I should consider? I'd say that crowds are a bit harsh for me, but they're slightly more manageable in open environments. My main interest is travelling around and hopefully see nice things and eat good food without too much stress. \n\nPretty much the only thing I am 100% sure of is Kaohsiung, so everything else can be changed. I enjoy temples, parks, and open-air museums a lot; I usually love museums in general, but I think I'm a bit hungover with four-hour-long history museums for now, unless they really are spectacular.

Im hyped about it, but I dont have the time I usually do to calculate every last detail, so I was hoping to make this a more chill experience by basing myself in Taipei except for one day in Kaohsiung and taking bunch of mostlyeasy day trips... but here is the itinerary, please rip into it and feel free to critique anything that doesnt fit. DAY 1 Arrive in Taipei in the early afternoon. Immigration, getting to the hostel, and maybe hang out in a creative parka literal park. If tired, just be at the hostel and get some work done. DAY 2 Visit a temple in the morning Lungshan Temple? Visit a museum current main candidates are the Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines or the National Museum. I am aware they are very different in scale, but I quite enjoy smaller museums! DAY 3 Trip to Yilan, visit the National Center for Traditional Arts OR Trip to Wulai, explore around leaning towards this at the moment DAY 4 Head to Kaohsiung in the morning. The schedule here will be very free, but the one thing I definitely want to see is Fo Guang Shan Temple. Mostly, though, Im meeting a local friend in Kaohsiung, so Ill let them take the lead. Sleep here. DAY 5 If anything is still left over to do in Kaohsiung, do it. Otherwise, take the train to Taipei again. Considering whether the slow train is worth the savings. Not much planned here; I was hoping to stop by in Taichung and take a short walk around the Rainbow Village, because I love colorful places and less museumy art, but Im worried it would be too long. DAY 6 Considering whether to do Jiufen and Shifen, even if its a weekend. On one hand, they look cool and my friend recommended them to me. On the other, they also look very touristy, and will probably be very busy. DAY 7 No solid plans. I will either improvise or ask for advice from people whove been around. I am also considering leaving this as my buffer day. Possible variations I have considered arriving in Taipei and immediately taking the train to Kaohsiung, but this would depend on my friends availability, and Im a little worried that it would be too tiring after waking up in the morning to take a bus to the airport, a flight, and then more trains. So please, critique my itinerary! Is there something I should skip? Something I should add? Something else I should consider? Id say that crowds are a bit harsh for me, but theyre slightly more manageable in open environments. My main interest is travelling around and hopefully see nice things and eat good food without too much stress. Pretty much the only thing I am 100 sure of is Kaohsiung, so everything else can be changed. I enjoy temples, parks, and openair museums a lot; I usually love museums in general, but I think Im a bit hungover with fourhourlong history museums for now, unless they really are spectacular. I am not the strongest person around, but if theres any fun hiking that wont be unbelievably crowded, Ill definitely consider it. However, Im travelling solo, so Im a little worried about wild trails.","sentiment_score":0.9977},{"submission_id":"1jgv8af","author":"bro6261resionpertive","created_utc":"2025-03-21T23:51:54.000Z","month_year":"03-2025","name":"t3_1jgv8af","num_comments":2,"score":2,"selftext":"Hi everyone!

He wasn\u2019t getting the philisophical bent to my query but it\u2019s all good, sufficient response.  \n\nHe got laid off, got rid of his $3k a month apartment, was now homeless and living in the hostel and running a start up postcard business. He took all his severance pay, five figures of severance pay, and designed and printed and packaged 200,000 San Francisco themed post card sets that he\u2019s sure are going to sell.  No one has bought them bulk yet but someone will, he talked to Amoeba music and they seemed interested, \u201csomeone needs to buy like 10k of these cuz im selling them on the street for $2 a pack, man, and it is not exactly making me the money i expected\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cOh really?!\u201d I exclaim, \u201cim a traveling artist, i work the fair and festival circuit.  I feel like there\u2019s some overlap here.\u201d  And i start to ask him questions about overhead and what the market is like and that a friend of mine is asking me to produce stickers for his roving festival booth; trying here to get some real information and trying to offer up information in return and Hakeem says.  \u201cI don\u2019t know man, I just started this two weeks ago.\u201d He\u2019s entirely uninterested in giving me the info i want, and also entirely unimpressed that im doing what he does but somewhat succeeding at it; as in later on in this very evening he\u2019ll be complaining about the people who make the kind of money i do while also wanting to be making that money himself.  It\u2019s all good, i really like the guy.  This disinterest and this spur of the moment; its all coming out of a positivity.  He\u2019s having fun and exploring and in a good moood and doesn\u2019t want to get into the bullshit details and i can respect that.  \n\nWe reach Chinatown and it is PACKED. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He exclaims.  We\u2019ve got a ticket to an event, an indoor event, but it is at the center of the outdoor event.  Some very very very famous DJ is doing an outdoor set as part of the inauguration celebration and he is EXACTLY the kind of dude that all these SF techies, these millennial kids with disposable income, are wiling to get trampled in a crowd for.  \n\nThis is exactly the kind of place id never be, the kind of place i would never freely choose to enter because danger danger danger is in crowds crowds crowds, but now im following Hakeem and his green super Mario kart beanie and using it as a beacon, while he pushes his way through a sardine packed crowd wall to wall in Chinatown that is of the kind i can just NOT properly explain.  This was packed, serious packed.  We were squeezing our way through one of those 1000 piece wheels of Chinese firecrackers.  Packed tight, right up against the other, wrapped in wax paper, rigid, unmoving; but Hakeem is determined to get to this party and he is pushing his way through the crowd and i am staying on him.  Gosh i hope that pack of Chinese firecrackers don\u2019t get neared to a spark. \n\nSurprisingly, we are almost to the stage.  We are dead center.  Every direction i look in; people.  Firecracker roll of people.  No way out through these people.  He sees some people he knows, a Brazilian guy.  They\u2019re holding up their cel phone, \u201chey Hakeem, say hi to Brazil!!\u201d  \u201cHi Brazil!!\u201d  \u201cThanks man, im filming content for my YouTube channel.\u201d  Ambitious youth suddenly climbs a streetlight, the tens of thousands all reach for their cel phones to get their video of the moment, the boy is a hero; the boy for one fleeting moment has the attention of everyone.  The DJ stops his set DEAD.  \u201cIm not playing one second more until you get down!!\u201d  He shouts.  \n\nThe DJ is dressed like a low rent Asian Neo from the matrix.  a 3rd tier imitation Asian imitating a guy who was a white WASP imitating the best of asian cinema.  He can\u2019t sing, hes out of tune with his track.  Rory, who\u2019s hiding in a restaurant alcove with me, whom i bought a beer and told him to remember that beer i bought him when the stampede starts, to save my life, to remember the beer, tells me \u201cthis is his hit song, this is what everyone is here for!!\u201d\u2019 \n\nIt\u2019s not impressive. \n\nHakeem grabs me by the shoulder.  \n\n\u201cLook at this, this is the San Francisco tech scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. I think hes meaning techno, as in these are the electronic music makers and fans.\n\n\u201cNo, this is the fucking tech scene.  These are all the young people making $150k a year to work on their laptops from home.  This is what they want, they just want to think they\u2019re cool and drink shitty beer and see a DJ and they think they are the best, that this is the best it can ever be\u201d.\n\nSuddenly the crowd starts pushing. Violently.  Not the whole crowd, just our corner.  People are shouting, \u201cstop pushing, people are going to get hurt!\u201d  A friend group that should have never come to this thing, who especially shouldn\u2019t have made their way to the center want OUT NOW and they are showing no respect and they are pushing their way to get out.  \n\n\u201cJust get out of the way, get out of the fucking way!\u201d  Some moron Jersey kid is shouting as he pushes an old Asian lady out of his way.  The rest of us, quite soberly and kindly, are shouting back \u201cslow down, calm down, stop pushing, we\u2019ll get you out.\u201d And they are having none of it.  Some 4 foot tall and 5 foot wide bald Greek guy in a paisley shirt and sunglasses that look like they cost about $1500 shouts \u201cfuck it!\u201d And heaves forward.  I yell \u201cstop this, people are going to get trampled!\u201d His friend, a girl who looks to be no more than 21, and who is clutching to him like a baby koala to its mothers belly, gets in my face and yells \u201cdidn\u2019t you take fucking physics class in high school you idiot?\u201d And im utterly shocked and say, \u201cwhat?!?!\u201d In response and she says it again; \u201cdidn\u2019t you take physics in high school you idiot\u201d and i am just too shocked, too blown over both by the self entitlement that these people are very very willing to hurt a lot of people just so they can get out (and wont get out if they cause a stampede, they\u2019ll die) and by the utter refutation of physics that she is expressing because all i can think about is thermo dynamics and critical mass and chain reaction and that if you push against a brick wall its not going to suddenly let you through- the physics is that if they push against a crowd and everyone falls over, people are going to get hurt.  But i guess this is the state of education in the \u2018ol USA cuz she\u2019s pretty confident in her physics knowledge and she\u2019s ready to kill us all just to get out.\n\nI understand why part of the country hates the other part.  I understand this anger.  \n\nI look at this angry group willing to kill everyone else, willing to push the people to the ground to get out.  They\u2019ve taken too much, that\u2019s what it is.  The crowd anxiety has set in.  Their eyes are coal black, dialated.  They\u2019re on something and what ever they are on, it\u2019s not mixing well with the scene. It\u2019s a Wednesday at 7pm, a work night.  It\u2019s a working class neighborhood.  It\u2019s Chinese restaurants, old ladies and old men standing in the doorways of their restaurants and scratching their heads at the scene and their regulars sitting inside and eating their congee and ignoring the throng outside, and these kids took too much because they are privileged as shit to party every night and treat every street like it is theirs and every crowd like it is in their way and they went to a bad place and they are in a big crowd and thank god enough of us were sane and we handled it well and we got those kids out of there before they caused a stampede.  They weren\u2019t nice, they didn\u2019t say thank you, they yelled at us and cursed at us and were full of poison and hate as we worked our asses off to save everyone\u2019s lives and stop a stampede and stop a trample and clear a path for them to get out.  They left, they didn\u2019t say thank you, i never encounter this kind of toxicity anywhere in the world except the USA; i understand why people hate us. \n\nA mom, a fucking mom, was trying to push through the crowd with her little baby in her arms!  What could have happpened to that baby had the crowd toppled?  But also, why the fuck did she push herself to the center of that crowd?!?!?  Why did a lady with a newborn see a packed crowd of thousands, no room to walk, and think \u201ci will walk me and my defenseless baby to the center of it!\u201d  Idiot, no sense of self preservation. \n\nI understand in that moment why half the country hates this half.  None of this is good.  It\u2019s bad, it\u2019s harmful.  But they\u2019re only harming themselves.  Really; we should let them do it, it\u2019s not hurting anyone.  It\u2019s dumb and its not that fun and its sad that they think this is fun but its even sadder that the rednecks and the white trash and the republicans resent these folks and are threatened by them.  Myself; I don\u2019t get it.  They are harmless, as long as you don\u2019t set them off. \n\n\u201cI got fired from my job cuz im a republican\u201d Hakeem tells me as an utterly methed out and rail thin cross dresser dances on the stairs leading into the basement restaurant we\u2019re having a quick beer in.  \u201cIt was all women working this job who hated trump and they didn\u2019t like me after I mentioned my politics. Before that, they all wanted to fuck me, but now they hate me.\u201d  He\u2019s black, dreadlocks down to his ass, as tall as my 6\u20193\u201d and with a youthful and handsome face; absolutely they wanted to fuck him. He has a super Mario beanie, hes starting a postcard business, he wants to travel the world.  I told him what i do, that i have an arts business and i travel the world, but he didn\u2019t wanna talk about that; he\u2019s still trying to get into the party.  \n\n\u201cThey just started letting anyone in, they aren\u2019t checking tickets anymore\u201d says a guy pushing past us in the crowd.  Fuck it.  There\u2019s no way we\u2019re\u2019 getting through this.  It\u2019s been an hour and a half and we haven\u2019t moved an inch past our spot by the restaurant.  This was amazing, im glad i came, im glad i saw this crowd, im glad i got to see how fucked up things can be; i gotta get out. \n\nI tell Hakeem and Rory, whom i bought the beer, \u201cthis is too much, I gotta get out\u201d and i push my way out, calmly and with friendly eyes and causing no problems, and i walk the streets and i listen to these young tech millennials walking these storied streets of the beat movement and the hippie movement and i see the writers and the jazz musicians and the cultural innovators in the grit and in the shadows and in the dust, their remnants kicked up in the winds making their way up here from the raging fires of Los Angeles, and in my walk i hear well over 15 separate groups of said young tech millennials saying to each other, \u201clets go to Vesuvius,\u201d in reference to some popular bar or nightclub, each one of them repeating the same script in the same tone of voice and each of them boasting that they\u2019d discovered this place and that it was their little secret and they are going to be a hero to their friends for showing it to them and i eventually walk by the place in my stroll and, surprise surprise, it\u2019s got a line out the door and im hearing the millennials bemoan \u201coh shit, we can\u2019t get into Vesuvius tonight\u201d.  \n\nI decide to hurry to my hostel, it is 10pm and im not sure if anyone will be working the front desk.  The door code issue was never fixed, i may not be able to get in.  \n\nI got in.

He got laid off, got rid of his 3k a month apartment, was now homeless and living in the hostel and running a start up postcard business. He took all his severance pay, five figures of severance pay, and designed and printed and packaged 200,000 San Francisco themed post card sets that hes sure are going to sell. No one has bought them bulk yet but someone will, he talked to Amoeba music and they seemed interested, someone needs to buy like 10k of these cuz im selling them on the street for 2 a pack, man, and it is not exactly making me the money i expected Oh really?! I exclaim, im a traveling artist, i work the fair and festival circuit. I feel like theres some overlap here. And i start to ask him questions about overhead and what the market is like and that a friend of mine is asking me to produce stickers for his roving festival booth; trying here to get some real information and trying to offer up information in return and Hakeem says. I dont know man, I just started this two weeks ago. Hes entirely uninterested in giving me the info i want, and also entirely unimpressed that im doing what he does but somewhat succeeding at it; as in later on in this very evening hell be complaining about the people who make the kind of money i do while also wanting to be making that money himself. Its all good, i really like the guy. This disinterest and this spur of the moment; its all coming out of a positivity. Hes having fun and exploring and in a good moood and doesnt want to get into the bullshit details and i can respect that. We reach Chinatown and it is PACKED. What is this? He exclaims. Weve got a ticket to an event, an indoor event, but it is at the center of the outdoor event. Some very very very famous DJ is doing an outdoor set as part of the inauguration celebration and he is EXACTLY the kind of dude that all these SF techies, these millennial kids with disposable income, are wiling to get trampled in a crowd for. This is exactly the kind of place id never be, the kind of place i would never freely choose to enter because danger danger danger is in crowds crowds crowds, but now im following Hakeem and his green super Mario kart beanie and using it as a beacon, while he pushes his way through a sardine packed crowd wall to wall in Chinatown that is of the kind i can just NOT properly explain. This was packed, serious packed. We were squeezing our way through one of those 1000 piece wheels of Chinese firecrackers. Packed tight, right up against the other, wrapped in wax paper, rigid, unmoving; but Hakeem is determined to get to this party and he is pushing his way through the crowd and i am staying on him. Gosh i hope that pack of Chinese firecrackers dont get neared to a spark. Surprisingly, we are almost to the stage. We are dead center. Every direction i look in; people. Firecracker roll of people. No way out through these people. He sees some people he knows, a Brazilian guy. Theyre holding up their cel phone, hey Hakeem, say hi to Brazil!! Hi Brazil!! Thanks man, im filming content for my YouTube channel. Ambitious youth suddenly climbs a streetlight, the tens of thousands all reach for their cel phones to get their video of the moment, the boy is a hero; the boy for one fleeting moment has the attention of everyone. The DJ stops his set DEAD. Im not playing one second more until you get down!! He shouts. The DJ is dressed like a low rent Asian Neo from the matrix. a 3rd tier imitation Asian imitating a guy who was a white WASP imitating the best of asian cinema. He cant sing, hes out of tune with his track. Rory, whos hiding in a restaurant alcove with me, whom i bought a beer and told him to remember that beer i bought him when the stampede starts, to save my life, to remember the beer, tells me this is his hit song, this is what everyone is here for!! Its not impressive. Hakeem grabs me by the shoulder. Look at this, this is the San Francisco tech scene. What? I ask. I think hes meaning techno, as in these are the electronic music makers and fans. No, this is the fucking tech scene. These are all the young people making 150k a year to work on their laptops from home. This is what they want, they just want to think theyre cool and drink shitty beer and see a DJ and they think they are the best, that this is the best it can ever be. Suddenly the crowd starts pushing. Violently. Not the whole crowd, just our corner. People are shouting, stop pushing, people are going to get hurt! A friend group that should have never come to this thing, who especially shouldnt have made their way to the center want OUT NOW and they are showing no respect and they are pushing their way to get out. Just get out of the way, get out of the fucking way! Some moron Jersey kid is shouting as he pushes an old Asian lady out of his way. The rest of us, quite soberly and kindly, are shouting back slow down, calm down, stop pushing, well get you out. And they are having none of it. Some 4 foot tall and 5 foot wide bald Greek guy in a paisley shirt and sunglasses that look like they cost about 1500 shouts fuck it! And heaves forward. I yell stop this, people are going to get trampled! His friend, a girl who looks to be no more than 21, and who is clutching to him like a baby koala to its mothers belly, gets in my face and yells didnt you take fucking physics class in high school you idiot? And im utterly shocked and say, what?!?! In response and she says it again; didnt you take physics in high school you idiot and i am just too shocked, too blown over both by the self entitlement that these people are very very willing to hurt a lot of people just so they can get out and wont get out if they cause a stampede, theyll die and by the utter refutation of physics that she is expressing because all i can think about is thermo dynamics and critical mass and chain reaction and that if you push against a brick wall its not going to suddenly let you through the physics is that if they push against a crowd and everyone falls over, people are going to get hurt. But i guess this is the state of education in the ol USA cuz shes pretty confident in her physics knowledge and shes ready to kill us all just to get out. I understand why part of the country hates the other part. I understand this anger. I look at this angry group willing to kill everyone else, willing to push the people to the ground to get out. Theyve taken too much, thats what it is. The crowd anxiety has set in. Their eyes are coal black, dialated. Theyre on something and what ever they are on, its not mixing well with the scene. Its a Wednesday at 7pm, a work night. Its a working class neighborhood. Its Chinese restaurants, old ladies and old men standing in the doorways of their restaurants and scratching their heads at the scene and their regulars sitting inside and eating their congee and ignoring the throng outside, and these kids took too much because they are privileged as shit to party every night and treat every street like it is theirs and every crowd like it is in their way and they went to a bad place and they are in a big crowd and thank god enough of us were sane and we handled it well and we got those kids out of there before they caused a stampede. They werent nice, they didnt say thank you, they yelled at us and cursed at us and were full of poison and hate as we worked our asses off to save everyones lives and stop a stampede and stop a trample and clear a path for them to get out. They left, they didnt say thank you, i never encounter this kind of toxicity anywhere in the world except the USA; i understand why people hate us. A mom, a fucking mom, was trying to push through the crowd with her little baby in her arms! What could have happpened to that baby had the crowd toppled? But also, why the fuck did she push herself to the center of that crowd?!?!? Why did a lady with a newborn see a packed crowd of thousands, no room to walk, and think i will walk me and my defenseless baby to the center of it! Idiot, no sense of self preservation. I understand in that moment why half the country hates this half. None of this is good. Its bad, its harmful. But theyre only harming themselves. Really; we should let them do it, its not hurting anyone. Its dumb and its not that fun and its sad that they think this is fun but its even sadder that the rednecks and the white trash and the republicans resent these folks and are threatened by them. Myself; I dont get it. They are harmless, as long as you dont set them off. I got fired from my job cuz im a republican Hakeem tells me as an utterly methed out and rail thin cross dresser dances on the stairs leading into the basement restaurant were having a quick beer in. It was all women working this job who hated trump and they didnt like me after I mentioned my politics. Before that, they all wanted to fuck me, but now they hate me. Hes black, dreadlocks down to his ass, as tall as my 63 and with a youthful and handsome face; absolutely they wanted to fuck him. He has a super Mario beanie, hes starting a postcard business, he wants to travel the world. I told him what i do, that i have an arts business and i travel the world, but he didnt wanna talk about that; hes still trying to get into the party. They just started letting anyone in, they arent checking tickets anymore says a guy pushing past us in the crowd. Fuck it. Theres no way were getting through this. Its been an hour and a half and we havent moved an inch past our spot by the restaurant. This was amazing, im glad i came, im glad i saw this crowd, im glad i got to see how fucked up things can be; i gotta get out. I tell Hakeem and Rory, whom i bought the beer, this is too much, I gotta get out and i push my way out, calmly and with friendly eyes and causing no problems, and i walk the streets and i listen to these young tech millennials walking these storied streets of the beat movement and the hippie movement and i see the writers and the jazz musicians and the cultural innovators in the grit and in the shadows and in the dust, their remnants kicked up in the winds making their way up here from the raging fires of Los Angeles, and in my walk i hear well over 15 separate groups of said young tech millennials saying to each other, lets go to Vesuvius, in reference to some popular bar or nightclub, each one of them repeating the same script in the same tone of voice and each of them boasting that theyd discovered this place and that it was their little secret and they are going to be a hero to their friends for showing it to them and i eventually walk by the place in my stroll and, surprise surprise, its got a line out the door and im hearing the millennials bemoan oh shit, we cant get into Vesuvius tonight. I decide to hurry to my hostel, it is 10pm and im not sure if anyone will be working the front desk. The door code issue was never fixed, i may not be able to get in. I got in.","sentiment_score":-0.9724},{"submission_id":"1ijndx4","author":"YukhoChan","created_utc":"2025-02-07T05:04:46.000Z","month_year":"02-2025","name":"t3_1ijndx4","num_comments":2,"score":3,"selftext":"Hello fellow travelers!

I am down for the party but its not at the fore front of my mind when planning this trip. I am a big fan of history and art, also love snorkelling so desperately looking for places to go where I can go right off the beach rather than having to book boat trips. The Perehtian Islands look great for it but I am unsure if the journey is worth it, its a bit of a detour and a lot of articles say that Kota Bharu isnt very nice. Something else to note is I am from London so being in big busy cities doesnt bother me. Also curious if adding Bali or Laos or the Philippines is worth exploring or if theres any other must visit places Ive missed. Would appreciate recommendations of activities to do and places to visit, how long to stay in each area.","sentiment_score":0.9722},{"submission_id":"1jiwr8f","author":"PourLeFromage","created_utc":"2025-03-24T17:43:17.000Z","month_year":"03-2025","name":"t3_1jiwr8f","num_comments":7,"score":0,"selftext":"Hello!\n\nThis upcoming June I am taking an extended solo trip beginning in Asia (Tokyo).

The airport was a little chaotic but getting through it was surprisingly quick. Bring $25 and a pen for the visa on arrival and immigration form. \n\nI took an Uber from the airport; had to turn down some taxi drivers but no one was aggressive, just tell them you have a car coming. Tip for taking Ubers: learn the Arabic numerals, because the license plates often only have Arabic numerals on them. \n\nMy initial impression of Cairo was that it looked visually really unique and interesting - it was my first trip to the Middle East\/Africa, and the desert environment + the monochromatic architectural aesthetic combined with the scale of the city was something I'd never really seen before and had me really excited to come back and explore after my detour to Alexandria.\n\nI took a 3 hour Go Bus to Alexandria which was pretty smooth and comfortable, and from the Alexandria bus station (which was admittedly a little chaotic) I took a yellow taxi to the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The taxi driver poached me as soon as I got off the bus so I was a little wary, but I was fine with the price he gave me so I just went with him (100 EGP = 2 USD). But don't be afraid to say no or haggle. \n\nI met my friend at the library, which is a grand, airy, modern building with some art and historical exhibits in it, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria. Following this we went the Roman-era Catacombs which were also quite cool. We walked around the nearby neighborhood which was getting pretty lively as people were starting to do their shopping in preparation for sundown. We walked around the Bahary neighborhood as well and wandered through the market there, and eventually made our way to the seaside for sunset. All in all Alexandria was nice, a bit chiller than Cairo, and a good introduction to Egypt for me. It was quite hard to find food as it was Ramadan, but this was expected.\n\n**Day 2: Coptic Cairo and Garbage City**\n\nWe took a car to Cairo in the morning, which cost 900 EGP = 30 USD. You can book a car through the inDrive app, which allows you to set a desired itinerary and price and then view and choose from offers from drivers. Super cool and convenient system, and a private taxi ride between Alexandria and Cairo is still cheaper than a train ticket for foreigners. \n\nOnce in Cairo, we checked into our hostel downtown (near Talaat Harb Square - there are a lot of hostels in this area), and then took the Metro (8 EGP = ~$0.20) over to Coptic Cairo, which was quite touristy but the old churches and cemetery were still very interesting. We wandered around on our own, ending at the Souq al Fustat nearby which had a good selection of handmade items\/ gifts to bring home. \n\nNext we took an Uber over to the St. Simon Monastery which is a cool church with an amphitheatre in a cave, tucked away requiring a drive through the crowded and hectic streets of the \"Garbage City\". The Monastery is very nice, just expect a fair number of tourists there (a lot of big groups coming in on tour buses, which I didn't expect here as I kept seeing this listed online as a less visited tourist site in Cairo). They also have a zipline there lol. We walked through the Garbage City a bit after checking out the Monastery. Again it's a pretty hectic neighborhood, and not the cleanest or more pleasant to walk in, but really interesting to see the informal system of garbage collection and recycling (especially as an urban planner myself). It was also interesting to explore a predominantly Christian neighborhood. We eventually caught a microbus who agreed to take us all the way to Maadi where we grabbed dinner. This part of the city was less interesting as a tourist - Maadi is relatively suburban and is an area popular with expats, with a number of international restos and chains here. \n\n**Day 3: Pyramids**\n\nToday we went to the Pyramids, which were honestly more impressive than I expected. A lot of tourists as expected, but still a spectacular sight. Lots of guys trying to get you to buy camel rides so if that bothers you idk lol you just have to keep saying no but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. We did end up giving in and doing a camel ride just for the experience lol but they're quite uncomfortable and just as slow as walking so I wouldn't really recommend. \n\nWe spent a few hours here and then took an Uber to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, which has most of its exhibits but is still not yet fully set up. The museum was cool, although the organization of the exhibits could've been a bit better and it didn't feel like there was much actual information conveyed in the exhibits (like I didn't really learn anything about the history, it was a lot more just looking at cool old things). Next time I would like to check out the Museum of Egyptian Civilization.\n\nNext we Ubered to Islamic Cairo because we wanted to do iftar here. We ended up at Al Azhar Mosque where they were setting up tables and chairs outside. A man told us to sit down so we did and joined a bunch of people who were sitting waiting for iftar. It was a sweet moment and the kids sitting next to us were super curious and friendly. We were given dates, rice, beans, and meat which we ate along with everyone else at sunset. Afterwards we got some tea and sweets on one of the nearby narrow commercial streets which at this point was very lively.\n\n**Day 4-6: Exploring Cairo**\n\nMy friend left so the last three days I spent solo in Cairo. I was originally thinking to go further afield and check out Saqqara and maybe the new capital that's been under construction, but I was experiencing really bad cat allergies from my hostel that were making me feel really tired and unwell so I didn't stray too far these days. \n\nI went to Zamalek, which is a chiller more upscale neighborhood. I spent my time just walking around, buying some souvenirs, eating at Zooba which was open for lunch during Ramadan, and getting delicious sweets from Mandarine Koueider nearby. \n\nI also returned to Islamic Cairo to see the sights during the daytime. The area is really interesting to wander around with more pedestrian-scale streets and old old buildings. So much history and really feels like you're somewhere unique with a storied past. \n\nI went up Bab Zuwayla which has a really great view over the old city, and I was the only person there at first. I also wandered around the narrow shopping streets nearby around Al Moiz and Khan Al Khalili. This portion had more tourists but still didn't feel overly touristed. The covered textile market south of Bab Zuwayla is cool, and I walked further south even beyond that were it became a very local market street which was super lively and stimulating to walk through. Vendors selling all kinds of produce and meat and bread and things. Young guys whizzing by on bicycles balancing long wooden frames on their heads with dozens of rounds of flatbread laid on top.\n\n I spent a good amount of time along Al Moiz exploring the shops and checking out the old streets and buildings. I also walked from here to the City of the Dead, which is a large necropolis where people have set up homes in the mausoleums. The walk from Islamic Cairo is not the nicest walk as it's basically along a highway for part of it but there's a pedestrian overpass that spits you out right at the entrance to the neighborhood. The view from the overpass is awesome, looking over the mausoleums with the beautiful old mosques poking out above them. Super interesting area to walk through - feels so different from the rest of the city. Very peaceful and I didn't see a lot of people, but definitely felt like an outsider and only saw like 2 tourists while I was there. I walked to Sultan Qaytbey Mosque, wandered a little bit, and then Ubered from here to Al Azhar Park. Very difficult to get an Uber from here, I would've been better off just getting a tuktuk from by the mosque. \n\nAl Azhar Park was my last stop, and is a nice green oasis in the city. Good views since it's on a hill, and a nice area to chill and regain some energy after walking around so much.\n\n\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n**Overall impressions and tips:**\n\n\u2014 Cairo was super cool. Such interesting glimpses of life in a one of a kind city with so much history and so much energy. A great place to wander around and great food too. \n\n\n\u2014 The Ramadan atmosphere was super cool to witness, with the city being fairly chill during the day and very lively late at night. It's like the analog to Christmas season, with decorations and Ramadan music playing everywhere. Food was definitely hard to find during the day, so definitely get a hostel that provides breakfast if you're traveling during Ramadan. Also keep in mind that most tourist sites close early so plan accordingly.\n\n\n\u2014 Food to try: koshary; taameya, the local version of falafel; pickled eggplant; molokhiya, a jute leaf soup; bamiya, an okra stew; and of course the sweets! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\n\u2014 Definitely helpful to learn a little bit of Egyptian Arabic as I didn't find there to be much English spoken. Learn how to say the numbers, learn how to ask how much (bekam), learn basic greetings and thank yous, learn how to ask for things (3andak..., momken...), yes\/no\/okay (aywa, la, meshi). Knowing some basics will go a long way to make your experience a little easier. \n\n\n\u2014 Egypt was very affordable, more affordable than I expected. For meals you can expect to spend anywhere from 10 to 200 EGP (divide by 50 to convert to USD). Ubers were usually 50-100 EGP. Dorms in hostels were around 250 EGP while private rooms in hostels were around 750 EGP.  Honestly felt even cheaper than India. \n\n\n\u2014 The Cairo Metro was great. Clean, super cheap, and very frequent. Also quite convenient for many of the places I was going to. Just tell the ticket booth what station you're going to and they'll give you the appropriate ticket. \n\n\n\u2014 Maybe I got lucky but I really didn't encounter much in the way of hassling or scams. I was asked for baksheesh a handful of times at mosques and other sites, but it's pretty easy to deal with (just say no or pretend you don't understand or just give them a little bit of money and be firm and say no if they ask for more). It was not frequent enough to mar my experience. People who were trying to sell me things were pretty easy to turn down, and I never felt unsafe (again disclaimer I am a man). Maybe it being Ramadan also had something to do with it, I'm not sure. \n\n\n\u2014 Go in with an open mind and be flexible. It's not a cozy and curated old European town or a well organized Japanese city, so you have to take it for what it is and be open to enjoying that. Think the scale and energy and palpable history of Istanbul, with the exciting chaos and overstimulation of a major Indian city. Don't go in expecting a pristine, calm city that caters to tourists. But if you're adaptable and interested in major world cities, seeing daily life in the largest city in the Arab world, and checking out Egypt's non-Ancient history, I absolutely recommend spending time in Cairo.

Just giving you guys my personal experience and want to provide a positivebalanced account on a destination that I see get a lot of flak. I just had a week to travel so I decided to stick to Cairo and Alexandria, and save LuxorAswan etc for another time to not spread myself too thin. Im really interested in cities and the more recent compared to Ancient Egypt history as well so I was perfectly happy filling my time in Cairo as it is a very historical city with a lot to see.

I really enjoyed Okinawa and the whole time the places occupancy rate were under 25% of capacity. The locals are kind and heavily rely on tourism. More tourist should consider Okinawa because there is a lot to offer and is under capacity.\n\nPlan: I was going to stay in Naha city for the convenience, being close to airport and more Airbnb options. I was going to explore more of south mainland Okinawa because its more accessible with bus. I was going to take a tour bus to view some highlights of northern Okinawa. I was going to skip the islands and very north of Okinawa because I didn\u2019t want to drive and there is already a lot to see in 8 days. I feel I can always go back to Okinawa so I don\u2019t need to see the entirety the first time.\n\nJanuary 4^(th)\n\nFlew in to Naha Airport at 5p.m. I checked in my Airbnb at 6:30p.m\n\nNaha Kokusai Dori Shopping Street: Very lively markets. There is more public music from restaurants. There are singers busking. There are a lot of markets and busy streets connected together. You can walk this area for a long time. I ate at a bar and oddly I was charged additional 300 yen table fee. First time hearing this fee. I googled it later and it\u2019s a thing here for locals too. I never saw the table fee at restaurants in Okinawa.\n\nJanuary 5^(th)\n\nOkinawa craft industry promotion center: Interesting concept. Part museum displaying crafts made in Okinawa. Part store. Part workshops area for weaving fabric and other crafts. Part private studios where artisans can make product out of. There is beautiful greenery in this area too. Free\n\n\u00a0\n\nJapanese navel headquarters visitors center: Alot of photos and video on the history of the Okinawa battle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFormer Japanese navy underground headquarters: 600Yen. Large tunnel network which some was restored for public to see.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa outlet mall ashibinaa: Odd to see a mix of semi luxury shopping with kids activities you would see at a carnival. Bouncy castles, train rides, small spinning amusement park rides.\n\nIias Okinawa Toyosaki. Has the generic stuff plus a cat caf\u00e9, connected to an aquarium, food court and many children\u2019s activities. In mall playgrounds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChura-san Beach: Nice little beach. I left early because it started to rain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 6^(th)\n\nOkinawa Hip Hop Bus Tour through Klook. It runs 2 days a week. On that day there were 13 Japanese tourist and 2 foreign tourist. Total 15 people went and the bus can hold 40. Tour guide was friendly and spoke Japanese and English for us 2 foreigners.\n\nVery fast and fun. There is no way I could reach half those places in a day with public bus.\n\nThe weather wasn\u2019t good so we skipped glass boat at kariyushi beach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNeopark: It kind of old and past it\u2019s prime but I liked the novelty.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa churaumi aquarium: I like this aquarium because it showed the big tank with whale shark and mantas. There wasn\u2019t \u201cfiller\u201d exhibits with goldfish and other small creatures which I already seen a lot of. There were few big exhibits with educational exhibits and logistic exhibits on how they capture and move the whale.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBise-fukugi tree road. There was a lot there to see. There was a scooter rental and a beach. I was only there for 30 minutes so I missed a lot of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYachimun no sato is a pottery place. There is a huge outdoor kiln that fires 2 times a year. There were a lot of pottery stores there and workshop. The prices were 2000-3000 yen for a plate or cup but its handmade.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican Village. Many large stores and buildings in an American style. There is lots of LEDS and there again things little kids would like. Such as large character statues.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Japanese are on time to get back to the tour bus. One Japanese ran and was panting when coming back to the tour bus when 3 minutes late, apologizing and bowing when entering back into the bus. The bus driver greets you every time you enter and exit the bus.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 7^(th)\n\nKarate museum. Turns out its a dojo and the owner lives upstairs in the building. There are no drop ins for the museum inside. No one answered the door when I range the bell.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural archaeological center. There was 2 exhibition rooms. About the origins of Okinawa. There wasn\u2019t much and little was translated into English. Free.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFarmers market yonabaru agarihama market: I thought it was a farmers market like said in google maps buts it\u2019s more of a grocery store. There they sold grain by the kg. There was a machine and attendant there ready to package your grain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarine plaza agarihama: A strip mall with large department stores. There was a daiso there which many items were 120yen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 8^(th)\n\nmanga souko urasoe: second hand store 2 floors. Lots of clothes, instruments, DVDs, video games.\n\n\u00a0\n\nmakeman urasoe main branch. Very large department store.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMinatogawa stateside town: The concept is each street is a U.S. state. There are many units that are cafes, retail, tattoo shop, craft workshop. There wasn\u2019t much going on. Many stores are closed and the prices are high.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural library: Library is floor 2-4. Tourist info center was in same building. Naha bus terminal was also here. I read short book about Japanese moving to Brazil after WW2 because at the same time Brazil abolish slavery so cheap labor was needed in the coffee plantations.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMatsuyama park: There was a tribute to a karate guy there. It was odd that the men\u2019s and women public washrooms entrances facing infront each other. Men can see straight into the women bathroom and vice versa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 9\n\nOkinawa world: Kinda touristy. The underground cave was nice. Staff took a free picture when we entered. When we exited we scanned the QR code and they printed a free small black and white photo. They offered an already printed and made color photo for 1000 yen. I declined and they threw the photo out. There was a snake show, fruit garden, many shops, glass demonstration.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI walked past a lot of sugar cane farms to\n\n\u00a0\n\nOjima island: Very small. I could walk it in 20 minutes.

There was sign saying glass bottom boat but most stores were closed when I was there at 7p.m.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 10^(th)\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural peace memorial museum: Very large, clean and comprehensive of the battle of Okinawa. Has testimonials, videos, artifacts, human scale replicas of stores, markets in the time after ww2. There was also an observatory tower.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeace memorial park. There was also an outdoor touchscreen to help you find where each person was located.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa Peace hall. A large Budda, paintings, garden and butterfly green house. All for 300 yen. I never went to see butterflies because its often $15+ in North America.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the memorials much at the south end because it started raining more and my umbrella broke.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHimeyuri cenotaph: Beautiful garden with sad story. I bought flowers for 300 yen.\n\nHimeyuri peace museum: very sad. The testimonials are very detail and immersive. I left early\n\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to cry so much.\n\nRyukyu glass village: There were demonstrations, stores, restaurants workshops. Very large.\n\nJanuary 11^(th)\n\nI walked to Naha bus terminal to get a refund on my okica card. There was a 200 yen fee. I got back around 1300 yen. Today and tomorrow I stop using buses and only monorail which I can pay with pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShurijo castle: I saw a lot of castles in mainland Japan so I didn\u2019t pay the 400 yen to enter. I walked through the outer castle area towards\u2026\n\nKinjo Stone road: The stone road was beside residential area. It must be tiresome to live on that rocky road. I found a marble on this road and kept it as souvenir.\n\nTamauden: I went in for 300 yen. There wasn\u2019t much to see but it wasn\u2019t expensive. Tamauden is a tomb of a royal family. There is also a beautiful garden here. There is a road with a row of old lush trees on each side. It is a nice picture spot that is empty a few minutes at a time.\n\nShuri Ryusen: Google maps said tourist attraction but its really a store on main level, coral painting t-shirts on 2^(nd)\u00a0level. There was so many tables on second floor, the capacity was 40 people but I was the only one there.\n\nOkinawa prefectural museum and art museum: The museum was 450 yen and art was 400 yen. I only saw the permanent exhibits. The museum was ok, pretty large and show a good summary of Okinawa. The history, artifacts, nature. The art was small. There were very few exhibits. 3 rooms. 1 media, 1 sculpture, 1 paintings.\n\nI walked through San-a-naha main place. Its a big mall with the usual.\n\nJanuary 12^(th)\n\nWoke up at 4am. Had breakfast from 7-11. Walk to nearest monorail and went straight to Naha airport via pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFood: It was my first time seeing Okinawa onigiri with egg and spam and was delicious. There are so many local restaurants. I only ate at a few restaurants and ordered there everyday. Once I find spots I like, I eat there the whole trip.\n\nI ate \u70c8\u706b\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u6696\u66ae \u90a3\u8987\u958b\u5357\u5e97 often. The owner has high standards and was patient in explaining to me how to order and pick noodle options. Owner remade my fried rice because an apprentice made a small mistake. Owner remade it himself. I didn\u2019t complain or ask for it to be remade. 450 yen fried rice. 850 yen ramen.\n\nI ate breakfast at Norichan 550 yen for the breakfast combo. I was really impressed with the discipline of this restaurant. The staff huddled in a circle. Someone gave instructions and staff enthusiastically said \u201chai!\u201d and starting working with intention.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTransportation:\n\nThe monorail coverage is short and a bit more expensive than Tokyo. 2-3 stops can be 300 yen. The monorail takes pasmo, Suica and Okica. The buses only use Okica card which you can buy at any monorail station. Including Naha Airport Station. You can also load the card with cash at a bus. Ask the driver to charge your card. I will spend 2000 yen round trip to southern Okinawa from Naha. There is also a lot to do near walking distance in Naha city so my transportation cost averaged around 1000 yen per day. Tokyo was 500 yen per day with a 72 hour pass.\n\nThe bus frequency is 10 \u2013 45 minutes. Some buses stop service at 8:00p.m. Sometimes I wait at a bus stop with google maps saying bus is arriving \u201cnow\u201d I see no bus and then my phone updates to the next bus in \u201c45 minutes\u201d or even worst my phone updates there is no more bus service that day. The next bus is 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. I walk to another bus stop closer to my destination and wait for another bus. Once the same thing happened to the second bus stop so I walked quite a bit more. I wasn\u2019t worried about safety because the weather was nice and the rain was short and mild. The bus cost is by distance so I remember my bus ride from Ojima Island to Naha city took 1 hour and cost around 850 yen.\n\nSeasonality: I think I was in off season. I check the Hip Hop Bus Tour now and is available every day. When I booked in January my tour was only available 2 days per week. On the tour day the 40 capacity bus had 15 people.\n\nWeather: I wore a light puffer jacket and pants. Sometimes a sweater or just t-shirt is enough. I always carried an umbrella. The rain comes unpredictably. The sky can be blue and sunny and suddenly rain lightly for 30 minutes to 3 hours. It rained 3 out of 8 days. \u00a0Temperature was 19C - 13C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConclusion: Okinawa felt like another country so was definitely worth the extra flights between Osaka and Taipei. The safety and hospitality felt same as mainland Japan. \u00a0The food cost is same or lower than Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka. My transportation cost was on average higher 500 yen per day in Okinawa than Tokyo. I found It odd that I was in off-season because the weather was so nice. I definitely want to go back in the future and explore the islands and northern Okinawa.\n\nSpending\n\n11980 yen Osaka to Okinawa plane ticket\n\n12496 yen Okinawa to Taipei plane ticket\n\n37489 yen Airbnb.

Plan I was going to stay in Naha city for the convenience, being close to airport and more Airbnb options. I was going to explore more of south mainland Okinawa because its more accessible with bus. I was going to take a tour bus to view some highlights of northern Okinawa.

I never went to see butterflies because its often $15+ in North America.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the memorials much at the south end because it started raining more and my umbrella broke.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHimeyuri cenotaph: Beautiful garden with sad story. I bought flowers for 300 yen.\n\nHimeyuri peace museum: very sad. The testimonials are very detail and immersive. I left early\n\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to cry so much.\n\nRyukyu glass village: There were demonstrations, stores, restaurants workshops. Very large.\n\nJanuary 11^(th)\n\nI walked to Naha bus terminal to get a refund on my okica card. There was a 200 yen fee. I got back around 1300 yen. Today and tomorrow I stop using buses and only monorail which I can pay with pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShurijo castle: I saw a lot of castles in mainland Japan so I didn\u2019t pay the 400 yen to enter. I walked through the outer castle area towards\u2026\n\nKinjo Stone road: The stone road was beside residential area. It must be tiresome to live on that rocky road. I found a marble on this road and kept it as souvenir.\n\nTamauden: I went in for 300 yen. There wasn\u2019t much to see but it wasn\u2019t expensive. Tamauden is a tomb of a royal family. There is also a beautiful garden here. There is a road with a row of old lush trees on each side. It is a nice picture spot that is empty a few minutes at a time.\n\nShuri Ryusen: Google maps said tourist attraction but its really a store on main level, coral painting t-shirts on 2^(nd)\u00a0level. There was so many tables on second floor, the capacity was 40 people but I was the only one there.\n\nOkinawa prefectural museum and art museum: The museum was 450 yen and art was 400 yen. I only saw the permanent exhibits. The museum was ok, pretty large and show a good summary of Okinawa. The history, artifacts, nature. The art was small. There were very few exhibits. 3 rooms. 1 media, 1 sculpture, 1 paintings.\n\nI walked through San-a-naha main place. Its a big mall with the usual.\n\nJanuary 12^(th)\n\nWoke up at 4am. Had breakfast from 7-11. Walk to nearest monorail and went straight to Naha airport via pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFood: It was my first time seeing Okinawa onigiri with egg and spam and was delicious. There are so many local restaurants. I only ate at a few restaurants and ordered there everyday. Once I find spots I like, I eat there the whole trip.\n\nI ate \u70c8\u706b\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u6696\u66ae \u90a3\u8987\u958b\u5357\u5e97 often. The owner has high standards and was patient in explaining to me how to order and pick noodle options. Owner remade my fried rice because an apprentice made a small mistake. Owner remade it himself. I didn\u2019t complain or ask for it to be remade. 450 yen fried rice. 850 yen ramen.\n\nI ate breakfast at Norichan 550 yen for the breakfast combo. I was really impressed with the discipline of this restaurant. The staff huddled in a circle. Someone gave instructions and staff enthusiastically said \u201chai!\u201d and starting working with intention.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTransportation:\n\nThe monorail coverage is short and a bit more expensive than Tokyo. 2-3 stops can be 300 yen. The monorail takes pasmo, Suica and Okica. The buses only use Okica card which you can buy at any monorail station. Including Naha Airport Station. You can also load the card with cash at a bus. Ask the driver to charge your card. I will spend 2000 yen round trip to southern Okinawa from Naha. There is also a lot to do near walking distance in Naha city so my transportation cost averaged around 1000 yen per day. Tokyo was 500 yen per day with a 72 hour pass.\n\nThe bus frequency is 10 \u2013 45 minutes. Some buses stop service at 8:00p.m. Sometimes I wait at a bus stop with google maps saying bus is arriving \u201cnow\u201d I see no bus and then my phone updates to the next bus in \u201c45 minutes\u201d or even worst my phone updates there is no more bus service that day. The next bus is 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. I walk to another bus stop closer to my destination and wait for another bus. Once the same thing happened to the second bus stop so I walked quite a bit more. I wasn\u2019t worried about safety because the weather was nice and the rain was short and mild. The bus cost is by distance so I remember my bus ride from Ojima Island to Naha city took 1 hour and cost around 850 yen.\n\nSeasonality: I think I was in off season. I check the Hip Hop Bus Tour now and is available every day. When I booked in January my tour was only available 2 days per week. On the tour day the 40 capacity bus had 15 people.\n\nWeather: I wore a light puffer jacket and pants. Sometimes a sweater or just t-shirt is enough. I always carried an umbrella. The rain comes unpredictably. The sky can be blue and sunny and suddenly rain lightly for 30 minutes to 3 hours. It rained 3 out of 8 days. \u00a0Temperature was 19C - 13C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConclusion: Okinawa felt like another country so was definitely worth the extra flights between Osaka and Taipei. The safety and hospitality felt same as mainland Japan. \u00a0The food cost is same or lower than Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka. My transportation cost was on average higher 500 yen per day in Okinawa than Tokyo. I found It odd that I was in off-season because the weather was so nice. I definitely want to go back in the future and explore the islands and northern Okinawa.\n\nSpending\n\n11980 yen Osaka to Okinawa plane ticket\n\n12496 yen Okinawa to Taipei plane ticket\n\n37489 yen Airbnb.

Reason of this trip report There wasnt much info on Okinawa when I was researching. I really enjoyed Okinawa and the whole time the places occupancy rate were under 25 of capacity. The locals are kind and heavily rely on tourism. More tourist should consider Okinawa because there is a lot to offer and is under capacity. Plan I was going to stay in Naha city for the convenience, being close to airport and more Airbnb options. I was going to explore more of south mainland Okinawa because its more accessible with bus. I was going to take a tour bus to view some highlights of northern Okinawa. I was going to skip the islands and very north of Okinawa because I didnt want to drive and there is already a lot to see in 8 days. I feel I can always go back to Okinawa so I dont need to see the entirety the first time. January 4th Flew in to Naha Airport at 5p.m. I checked in my Airbnb at 630p.m Naha Kokusai Dori Shopping Street Very lively markets. There is more public music from restaurants. There are singers busking. There are a lot of markets and busy streets connected together. You can walk this area for a long time. I ate at a bar and oddly I was charged additional 300 yen table fee. First time hearing this fee. I googled it later and its a thing here for locals too. I never saw the table fee at restaurants in Okinawa. January 5th Okinawa craft industry promotion center Interesting concept. Part museum displaying crafts made in Okinawa. Part store. Part workshops area for weaving fabric and other crafts. Part private studios where artisans can make product out of. There is beautiful greenery in this area too. Free Japanese navel headquarters visitors center Alot of photos and video on the history of the Okinawa battle. Former Japanese navy underground headquarters 600Yen. Large tunnel network which some was restored for public to see. Okinawa outlet mall ashibinaa Odd to see a mix of semi luxury shopping with kids activities you would see at a carnival. Bouncy castles, train rides, small spinning amusement park rides. Iias Okinawa Toyosaki. Has the generic stuff plus a cat caf\u00e9, connected to an aquarium, food court and many childrens activities. In mall playgrounds. Churasan Beach Nice little beach. I left early because it started to rain. January 6th Okinawa Hip Hop Bus Tour through Klook. It runs 2 days a week. On that day there were 13 Japanese tourist and 2 foreign tourist. Total 15 people went and the bus can hold 40. Tour guide was friendly and spoke Japanese and English for us 2 foreigners. Very fast and fun. There is no way I could reach half those places in a day with public bus. The weather wasnt good so we skipped glass boat at kariyushi beach. Neopark It kind of old and past its prime but I liked the novelty. Okinawa churaumi aquarium I like this aquarium because it showed the big tank with whale shark and mantas. There wasnt filler exhibits with goldfish and other small creatures which I already seen a lot of. There were few big exhibits with educational exhibits and logistic exhibits on how they capture and move the whale. Bisefukugi tree road. There was a lot there to see. There was a scooter rental and a beach. I was only there for 30 minutes so I missed a lot of it. Yachimun no sato is a pottery place. There is a huge outdoor kiln that fires 2 times a year. There were a lot of pottery stores there and workshop. The prices were 20003000 yen for a plate or cup but its handmade. American Village. Many large stores and buildings in an American style. There is lots of LEDS and there again things little kids would like. Such as large character statues. The Japanese are on time to get back to the tour bus. One Japanese ran and was panting when coming back to the tour bus when 3 minutes late, apologizing and bowing when entering back into the bus. The bus driver greets you every time you enter and exit the bus. January 7th Karate museum. Turns out its a dojo and the owner lives upstairs in the building. There are no drop ins for the museum inside. No one answered the door when I range the bell. Okinawa prefectural archaeological center. There was 2 exhibition rooms. About the origins of Okinawa. There wasnt much and little was translated into English. Free. Farmers market yonabaru agarihama market I thought it was a farmers market like said in google maps buts its more of a grocery store. There they sold grain by the kg. There was a machine and attendant there ready to package your grain. Marine plaza agarihama A strip mall with large department stores. There was a daiso there which many items were 120yen. January 8th manga souko urasoe second hand store 2 floors. Lots of clothes, instruments, DVDs, video games. makeman urasoe main branch. Very large department store. Minatogawa stateside town The concept is each street is a U.S. state. There are many units that are cafes, retail, tattoo shop, craft workshop. There wasnt much going on. Many stores are closed and the prices are high. Okinawa prefectural library Library is floor 24. Tourist info center was in same building. Naha bus terminal was also here. I read short book about Japanese moving to Brazil after WW2 because at the same time Brazil abolish slavery so cheap labor was needed in the coffee plantations. Matsuyama park There was a tribute to a karate guy there. It was odd that the mens and women public washrooms entrances facing infront each other. Men can see straight into the women bathroom and vice versa. January 9 Okinawa world Kinda touristy. The underground cave was nice. Staff took a free picture when we entered. When we exited we scanned the QR code and they printed a free small black and white photo. They offered an already printed and made color photo for 1000 yen. I declined and they threw the photo out. There was a snake show, fruit garden, many shops, glass demonstration. I walked past a lot of sugar cane farms to Ojima island Very small. I could walk it in 20 minutes. Nice views and restaurant. There were families teaching their toddler how to fish and kids baseball game happening there. There was sign saying glass bottom boat but most stores were closed when I was there at 7p.m. January 10th Okinawa prefectural peace memorial museum Very large, clean and comprehensive of the battle of Okinawa. Has testimonials, videos, artifacts, human scale replicas of stores, markets in the time after ww2. There was also an observatory tower. Peace memorial park. There was also an outdoor touchscreen to help you find where each person was located. Okinawa Peace hall. A large Budda, paintings, garden and butterfly green house. All for 300 yen. I never went to see butterflies because its often 15 in North America. I didnt see the memorials much at the south end because it started raining more and my umbrella broke. Himeyuri cenotaph Beautiful garden with sad story. I bought flowers for 300 yen. Himeyuri peace museum very sad. The testimonials are very detail and immersive. I left early because I didnt want to cry so much. Ryukyu glass village There were demonstrations, stores, restaurants workshops. Very large. January 11th I walked to Naha bus terminal to get a refund on my okica card. There was a 200 yen fee. I got back around 1300 yen. Today and tomorrow I stop using buses and only monorail which I can pay with pasmo. Shurijo castle I saw a lot of castles in mainland Japan so I didnt pay the 400 yen to enter. I walked through the outer castle area towards Kinjo Stone road The stone road was beside residential area. It must be tiresome to live on that rocky road.

Which of these cities, or any others, have other solo travelers and possibly a weekday nightlife? It would also be fun to just tag along with other travelers. Also, I would love any good hostel recommendations in any of these cities. Im east asian looking if that matters.

I\u2019m not that big of a foodie and I don\u2019t like to eat alone, so fuel has been merely a fuel for me so far but I\u2019m willing to expand my views on that. \n\nIve been thinking about two separate ares I\u2019d like to go to. First Mexico City and Cancun area. I\u2019ve heard great thing about CDMX and I figured it would be a waste not to see it when travelling to Mexico. I\u2019d watch football, go to the museums, see some parks and forests and just enjoy what the city has to offer. I speak Spanish on a decent level so it would be of use.\n\nFrom there I\u2019d fly to Cancun, the beaches are supposed to be phenomenal and better than in the other area I\u2019ve thought about. I\u2019d enjoy the weather and beach life there, visit Bacalar and Chacchoben, Valladolid, Isla Mujeres, and very much would love to see the forests around there. Then I\u2019d fly back to CDMX and fly back to HEL. I\u2019d have a layover in DFW that could be a bit of a hassle, or so I\u2019ve been told. \n\nThe second area is SEA. I\u2019d fly to Singapore and spend some time there, then I\u2019d go to Kuala Lumpur. From there I\u2019d go to Langkawi and chill and enjoy the beaches there. I could also catch a ferry to Koh Lipe to see Thailand as well. In these parts I\u2019d love to see the nature, and relax. \n\nSo my conclusions are: in Mexico I could see CDMX that I\u2019ve heard so much good about, watch football live, see the beautiful beaches, practise my Spanish and see the ruins. But it would probably be a more challenging first long solo trip, more expensive and a bit more unsafe than in SEA. I probably couldn\u2019t relax as much. Travelling there would be more work too.\n\nTo Singapore I could fly straight from HEL, and on that trip see potentially 2 other countries as well in Malaysia and Thailand, and two major Asian metropolies in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. It would be more safe and cheaper there. The beaches supposedly aren\u2019t as good as in Quintana Roo in Cancun area, and maybe the weather as well,  in Langkawi it could maybe get pretty wet where I\u2019d probably spend most of my time in. But Koh Lipe also interests me, it looks pretty there. \n\nThese are my thoughts, the plans are on a quite basic level so that\u2019s why I\u2019m very open to critique, and any kind of advice and recommendations. I know there\u2019s a not much time until around mid April when I\u2019d go, so I have that in mind.

When I presented the ticket, the driver looked very disgruntled, pointed at the back of the bus, and tried to communicate something to me in Japanese which unfortunately I didn\u2019t understand. Obviously I had done something wrong at that point, but given a whole bus load of people were waiting for me (I have social anxiety), I just focused on problem solving and trying to pay for the fare.  I tried asking how to pay in English (so that he would know I didn\u2019t understand him) and pointed at my IC\/subway card hoping to communicate visually. It was the main form of payment in Kyoto, so I assumed it was. He seemed to agree, I used my card, and I turned to walk off the bus. Before I even took a step, he HIT ME on my arm, HARD.  I was aghast.  It wasn\u2019t a tap, or even a grab to make sure I didn\u2019t leave. It was a straight up painful smack on the inner bone right below my rotator cuff.

I just don\u2019t think what I did warranted violence. \n\nThere are some things that I felt contributed to it being confusing already - why was there a ticket dispenser there when shouldn\u2019t be used? Every city has their own way of what is needed to pay for a fare\/seat - when I did the Kumano Kodo, they used this ticketing system. Local buses in Kyoto don\u2019t even have the ticket dispenser. Also why didn\u2019t he just manually input the fare in the first place when he saw the ticket? \n\nI don\u2019t know what I need. I guess I need a rant. Maybe some level of understanding. Or just to know I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019ve been feeling painful loneliness and so out of place here, it\u2019s hard not to catastrophize what happened.  \n\nI\u2019m distracting myself now with a hike but would love to hear from others who may have had a similar experience or can help me expand my perspective a bit. Thanks so much for reading this far.\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you everyone for taking the time to respond! The comments really helped me get through the day.  I can\u2019t respond to every comment but I upvoted anyone who contributed positively (including similar experiences, philosophical musings on cultural aspects that may have caused this, general commiseration, etc). \n\nFor everyone else trying to explain how bus fares work, you can stop. I\u2019m not confused, and many of your assumptions are frankly incorrect and advice misguided.  The bus I was on was not using a flat fee single ride fare system. \n\nI can understand and empathize with the driver\u2019s frustration. What I do not understand is the violence and why so many people think it\u2019s justified.  I\u2019m starting to wonder if (hope that?) a lot of these troll comments are bots.. \n\nEdit2:\n\nI\u2019m going to try to write the complaint in Japanese (via google translate) to reduce the amount of barriers it takes to get this thing filed and to the right eyes. Sadly I don\u2019t have any Japanese speaking friends, but if anyone wants to volunteer to proofread it, it\u2019d be so helpful. Ping me if you\u2019d be down! Thanks in advance.

Every city has their own way of what is needed to pay for a fareseat when I did the Kumano Kodo, they used this ticketing system. Local buses in Kyoto dont even have the ticket dispenser. Also why didnt he just manually input the fare in the first place when he saw the ticket? I dont know what I need. I guess I need a rant. Maybe some level of understanding. Or just to know Im not alone. Ive been feeling painful loneliness and so out of place here, its hard not to catastrophize what happened. Im distracting myself now with a hike but would love to hear from others who may have had a similar experience or can help me expand my perspective a bit. Thanks so much for reading this far. Edit Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond! The comments really helped me get through the day. I cant respond to every comment but I upvoted anyone who contributed positively including similar experiences, philosophical musings on cultural aspects that may have caused this, general commiseration, etc. For everyone else trying to explain how bus fares work, you can stop. Im not confused, and many of your assumptions are frankly incorrect and advice misguided. The bus I was on was not using a flat fee single ride fare system. I can understand and empathize with the drivers frustration. What I do not understand is the violence and why so many people think its justified. Im starting to wonder if hope that? a lot of these troll comments are bots.. Edit2 Im going to try to write the complaint in Japanese via google translate to reduce the amount of barriers it takes to get this thing filed and to the right eyes. Sadly I dont have any Japanese speaking friends, but if anyone wants to volunteer to proofread it, itd be so helpful. Ping me if youd be down!

Im planning a 12 days trip to Vietnam north and central regions next month and Im sort of hesitating after reading some stuff about Vietnam even though it is my top dream destination. I read that you cant rely on reviews since theyre mostly fakebought by restaurant and hotel owners, and that you have to be careful where to buy your sim card since you will most likely be sold a used one. And that youll have to be ready to do a lot of haggling for prices otherwise youll be scammed. A lot of tips given regarding these issues involve socializing with the locals to get recommendations from them and winging it along the way to experiment with stuff. Now the real problem is not the things Ive read, its that I have crippling social anxiety so I dont think I can manage chatting up locals that probably dont even speak English well to get their recommendations, and haggling is a traumatic experience for me, and Im so very terrified from going there without planning everything down to the restaurants I will eat at every day.

No one in my family travels much for pleasure outside of a few beach vacations to the Caribbean. I had only been outside of the US to travel to Aruba up until about 18 months ago. Finding this sub by chance has lead me to read hundreds of stories, learn about peoples experiences, and come to understand that there is so much that can be done alone. I have been fortunate enough to have started truly traveling, and over the last 18 months have been to Europe 3 times, and am in the beginning stages of planning a few other over the next 18 months, including a possible trip to Japan SE Asia. Traveling solo is pretty far outside my comfort zone, due to a couple factors, but is something I genuinely believe I am going to love. I enjoy solace, and meeting new people.

If my country matters for this im from Germany.","sentiment_score":0.7079},{"submission_id":"1izgjnm","author":"Asskickingspree","created_utc":"2025-02-27T14:05:50.000Z","month_year":"02-2025","name":"t3_1izgjnm","num_comments":12,"score":7,"selftext":"I'm staying in the center of Tokyo (near imperial palace) in May and I have a very limited time in Japan, approx 7-8 nights only.\n\nThere are a few attractions that will require 1 or more hours by car! to reach (way more by public transport) and I want to know if they are worth the time or not?

Here is my rough plan 314 arrive in Da Nang in the evening 315 Da Nang Hoi An 316 Hoi An Hue 317 Hue 318 Hue Ninh Binh 319 Ninh Binh 320 Ninh Binh Ha Giang 321 Ha Giang 322 Ha Giang 323 Ha Giang 324 Ha Giang Hanoi 325 Hanoi 326 Hanoi 327 depart Hanoi in the evening Some considerations I really want to do the full 4day Ha Giang loop and not cut it to 3 if I dont have to. The dates arent set though, Ill just need to leave from Hanoi on the 27th unless its not crazy to try to go from Ha Giang to Hong Kong? I recognize this plan has basically two full travel days on the 18th and 20th, but I figure this allows me to not break up my time in Hanoi. Open to suggestions on better approaches though. Im very torn between wanting to split my time in nature and in cities. In this current plan I worry I wont have enough time to truly appreciate Hanoi, but having taken a look at Ninh Binh it feels unskippable! Is 3 nights 2 days enough time in Hanoi to get a good impression and see a lot, or should I just save Ninh Binh for a future trip? Id love to enjoy some of Hanois nightlife. How is the nightlife scene on a Thurs. vs. Fri. vs. Sat, or is it cosmopolitan enough that there are parties to be found any night of the week?

Day 3 Walk around Odaiba, go to teamLab Planets, rest of day get lost Day 4 Go to Sensoji and Ueno park, then to Akihabara on the way back Day 5 Go to Chidorigafuchi Park, the imperial palace, then Kabukicho at night and the GoldenGai Day 6 Leave for Kanazawa early in the morning, try to hit Kenrokuen, Nagamachi DIstrict, and Gyokusenin Maru garden Day 7 Day trip to Shirakawa Day 8 Travel from Kanazawa to Osaka, stop at Fukui on the way. Hit Eiheji and the Dino museum so sad Im missing the pokemon fossil museum Day 9 Go to Kyoto, hit Fushimi Inari Taisha in the morning, then Kenkakuji, Haradani Garden, and Otagi Nenbutsuji temple if anyone has been here is it worth going? Its kind of out of the way Day 10 Kyoto again, Kiyomizudera, Yasaka Pagoda, Shinsenen, Nijo castle Day 11 Nara, small trail as well up Mount Wakakusa Day 12 Day in Osaka Dotonbori, Namba Yasaka Jinja, etc. Day 13 Nothing planned probably Kyoto or Osaka, hit an onsen Day 14 Back to Tokyo for the trip home I debated going to Kanazawa vs Nagoya and decided Kanazawa because I feel like theres more to offer, I also wanted to check out Fukui. Before you guys comment on why Im staying in both shibuya and odaiba, its because Im meeting a friend. Also, where do you buy train tickets? Theres so many different places online. Also if theres any insane food recs lmk. Thanks again!","sentiment_score":0.5715},{"submission_id":"1ixor5y","author":"newcsgrad20202020","created_utc":"2025-02-25T06:40:01.000Z","month_year":"02-2025","name":"t3_1ixor5y","num_comments":36,"score":13,"selftext":"Hi all,\n\nThis will be my first time doing a solo trip to Turkey for 6 days and I was thinking of doing these:\n\nTuesday, May 13 (Istanbul):\n- 5:30am: Arrive to Istanbul\n- Drop off luggage at hotel\n- At Istanbul:\n  - Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque (opens 24\/7)\n  - See Spice Bazaar (opens 8:30am - 7:30pm)\n  - The Blue Mosque (opens 9am-6pm)\n  - Basilica Cistern (opens 9am - 6:30pm; 7:30pm - 10pm)\n  - Lunch somewhere here\n  - Topkapi Palace (opens 9am - 5pm)\n  - Grand Bazaar (opens 10am - 5:30pm)\n- 2:30pm: Check into hotel\n\nWednesday, May 14 (Istanbul):\n- 9:00am: Check out of hotel\n- Fly to Cappadocia at night (8pm)\n\nThursday, May 15 (Cappadocia):\n- Hot air balloon\n- Visit Goreme Open Air Museum for ancient cut-out churches\n- Visit G\u00f6reme National Park\n- See the underground city of Derinkuyu or Kaymakli\n- See Cappadocia at night\n\nFriday, May 16 (Cappadocia):\n- Take a hike through the Pigeon Valley and Love Valley\n- Go to Avanos town to see pottery\n- Take overnight bus from Cappadocia (Gerome) to Pamukkale (Denizli)\n  - Can use Flix bus (link); book < 2 months in advance (March)\n\nSaturday, May 17 (Pamukkale):\n- Take taxi from Denizli bus station to Pamukkale\n- In Pamukkale:\n  - See the thermal pools\n  - See Pamukkale Amphitheater\n  - See the Ancient City Of Hierapolis\n- Fly from Denizli to Istanbul late at night\n- Stay at airport hotel\n\nSunday, May 18 (Istanbul):\n- Explore Bosphorus:\n- Galata Tower\n- Pasaj\u0131\n- Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace\n\nMonday, May 19 (Airport)\n- 6:55am: Depart from Istanbul \n- 10:30am: Arrive to SFO\n\nDo you guys think this is a good plan?

Monday March 10th arrive in HCMC Wed March 12th go to Phu Quoc spend four nights Sunday March 16th go to Hoi An two nights Tuesday March 18th Fly to Hanoi spend three nights Friday March 19th go to Cat Ba for wedding over weekend Sunday back to Hanoi for flight home Thanks in advance!","sentiment_score":0.957},{"submission_id":"1iw7k62","author":"rye94","created_utc":"2025-02-23T10:49:10.000Z","month_year":"02-2025","name":"t3_1iw7k62","num_comments":8,"score":1,"selftext":"I\u2019ve been to India once before in 2018 for about 3 weeks.

I just dont know how to feel, this trip messed me up but in a good way and it really opened my mind on the monotony of what my life is like back home. Of course I want to be back, but Id rather not count days until then. For now, Ive been evaluating myself and taking actions to fix the bad habits Ive been so oblivious of for so long. I still feel melancholic but at the same time so grateful, I want to go back so bad but life here has my vices on me. Thank you for reading my long rant EDIT Didnt expect the overwhelming response, thank you so much for all your kind words and perspectives. Ive been feeling a lot better and adjusting back to everyday life, of course with the occasional melancholy feeling, but with time that should ease out. Now Im looking at and planning for my next trip in June hopefully to Nepal!","sentiment_score":0.9743},{"submission_id":"1iv59oh","author":"Travel_aus_694","created_utc":"2025-02-21T23:40:26.000Z","month_year":"02-2025","name":"t3_1iv59oh","num_comments":10,"score":0,"selftext":"Hello! I'm a future solo traveller from Australia (25F) and I'm heading to Vietnam by myself in May this year.

Stay in Ho Chi Minh City from Monday to Wednesday. I'm not sure about this, as I've heard from friends that there isn't much to do in HCMC other than party and shop, which isn't really my goal.

I get quite anxious waiting in long lines at airport security as I worry about missing my flight! \n\n  \nSince my trip is only 10 days long and I'm working remotely during Australian office hours I'm keen to make the most of the short time I do have in Vietnam.

Edit I had two good nights of sleep in a nice hotel and finally was able to eat two meals yesterday and feeling much better and more confident, thank you to everyone in the comments for the reassuring words ! Edit 2 to all the people reacting to me saying that Bangkok was traumatic, Ive been to a lot of huge cities like New York, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Lisboa, Bamako and never had the same feeling. Nothing against thai culture or people, people were really nice and I felt very safe travelling around in Bangkok. I mainly narrow it down to the pollution of the air and the sudden change of temperature going for minus 5 to 33 Celsius in the same day and the jetlag and lack of sleep.","sentiment_score":0.9921},{"submission_id":"1itzkks","author":"Flashy_Swordfish_326","created_utc":"2025-02-20T14:21:40.000Z","month_year":"02-2025","name":"t3_1itzkks","num_comments":1,"score":1,"selftext":"Hi guys, may I know if any of you already tried to go to Australia for holiday using the subclass 600 business stream?

I'm a fairly seasoned solo traveler and backpacker, but I haven't done too much travelling since Covid.  So I'm excited to get back out on my first real solo trip since then.  I plan on focusing my trip around history, nature, food, and maybe some light partying, but I'm definitely starting to age out of the partying part.  I plan on staying in private rooms in hostels so I can easily meet other travelers while still getting comfort and privacy when I need it.  \n\nI know July is the rainy season in Cambodia, and I'm wondering how rainy it actually is.  Is this trip still worth doing that time of year?  I've read that it mostly just monsoons that last for an hour or so in the afternoons. I live in Phoenix, so I'm familiar with them and the chaos that monsoons bring.  \n\nItinerary\n\n7\/4 - Arrive Phnom Penh  \nHostel - Onedrez  \nThe flight I'm looking at lands at 10pm so I'll probably just head to the hostel and go to bed.  \n\n7\/5 - Phnom Penh  \nHostel - Onedrez  \nDuring the day do S21 and the Killing Field, and in the evening hang out at the hostel and go to a night market for dinner.  I was considering doing Phnom Penh at the end of the trip but my primary interests there are the Khmer Rouge related attractions and I don't want to end on a depressing note.  I'm assuming the emotions will be similar to visiting Dachau or other Holocaust related sites\n\n7\/6 - Flight to Siem Reap  \nHostel -  Lub d  \nI try to minimize activities on travel days since they can be unpredictable.  I plan on just checking in to my hostel and then finding a motorbike to rent for my time in Siem Reap.  I heard you can buy the Tickets for Angkor Wat the afternoon before, so I'll probably do that to beat the lines.    \n\n7\/7 - 7\/9 - Siem Reap   \nHostel -  Lub d  \nI plan on spending most of my time motorbiking around Angkor Wat and the other temples.  I'll would like to find a tour of Angkor Wat itself so I can learn the history of it.  Am I able to just show up and find a tour guide?  I saw there is a landmine museum here so I'll check that out one day.  \n\n7\/10 - Boat to Battambang  \nHostel - The Place  \nI read that there is a boat from Siem Reap to Battambang.  I thought that looks like a interesting was to get there.  I'm also debating just driving a motorbike there my self, but I'm leaning towards a boat at the moment.  \n\n7\/11 - Battambang  \nHostel - The Place  \nI've read that Battambang can give you a more authentic taste of Cambodia since its slightly off the main beaten path.  I plan on doing the Bamboo Train, crocodile farm, and Bat cave.  I'm going to rent a motorbike to get around.  \n\n7\/12 - Journey to Koh Rong  \nHostel - The Lost Boys  \nThis will be far be the most complicated travel day, so any advise on how to do this will be welcomed.  It looks like there is an 11:30am flight from Siem Reap to Sihanoukville.  I think this is my best option.  My current plan is to get a taxi or shell out the cash and hire a private driver to get me to the airport.  It seem to be about a 3 hour drive to the airport so I'll need to be on the road by 6am for this to work.  I don't know how easy it will be to find a taxi this early in the morning so a private driver may be the better option.  Once I manage to get to Sihanoukville, get a Grab to the pier and a ferry to Koh Rong.  \n\n7\/13 -7\/15 - Koh Rong  \nHostel - The Lost Boys  \nI plan on just exploring the Island just relaxing on the beaches.  I'll probably try to go SCUBA diving, I already have a PADI Advanced Open Water certification.  One of the days I might head over to Koh Rong Sanloem and check that island out.  \n\n7\/16 - Bus to Kampot  \nHostel - Karma Traders  \nI'll probably get the first ferry out of Koh Rong in the morning.  Once I get to the hostel I'll find a motorbike and explore the town and hit up a night market for dinner.   \n\n7\/17 - 7\/18 - Kampot  \nHostel - Karma Traders  \nOne of the days I plan on motorbiking around Bokor National Park and looking the the French Ruins.  I also plan on going in to Kep and checking out the crab market, I don't know if that will be the same day or not.  I will try to kayak one day on the river.  I may do the Kampot pepper farm tour if there is time, but that's not a must do for me.  \n\n7\/19 - Head back to the 120F desert I call home  \nI think getting a early morning bus makes the most sense.  The flight I'm looking at leaves at 11:30pm so I should be good on time even with the unreliable transportation.  If I end up having time I might find a market to checkout.  \n\n7\/20 - Bonus day in Seoul  \nThe flight I'm looking at has an eleven hour layover in Inchon and lands at 7am.  I'm thinking I'll head in Seoul for the day.  I don't really know what I'm going to do so I'm open to suggestions\n\nHow does this itinerary look? Am I missing anything that a must see or do?  Also, if anyone as suggestions for restaurants or anything, I'd love the hear them.

Im also debating just driving a motorbike there my self, but Im leaning towards a boat at the moment. 711 Battambang Hostel The Place Ive read that Battambang can give you a more authentic taste of Cambodia since its slightly off the main beaten path. I plan on doing the Bamboo Train, crocodile farm, and Bat cave. Im going to rent a motorbike to get around. 712 Journey to Koh Rong Hostel The Lost Boys This will be far be the most complicated travel day, so any advise on how to do this will be welcomed. It looks like there is an 1130am flight from Siem Reap to Sihanoukville. I think this is my best option. My current plan is to get a taxi or shell out the cash and hire a private driver to get me to the airport. It seem to be about a 3 hour drive to the airport so Ill need to be on the road by 6am for this to work. I dont know how easy it will be to find a taxi this early in the morning so a private driver may be the better option. Once I manage to get to Sihanoukville, get a Grab to the pier and a ferry to Koh Rong. 713 715 Koh Rong Hostel The Lost Boys I plan on just exploring the Island just relaxing on the beaches. Ill probably try to go SCUBA diving, I already have a PADI Advanced Open Water certification. One of the days I might head over to Koh Rong Sanloem and check that island out. 716 Bus to Kampot Hostel Karma Traders Ill probably get the first ferry out of Koh Rong in the morning. Once I get to the hostel Ill find a motorbike and explore the town and hit up a night market for dinner. 717 718 Kampot Hostel Karma Traders One of the days I plan on motorbiking around Bokor National Park and looking the the French Ruins. I also plan on going in to Kep and checking out the crab market, I dont know if that will be the same day or not. I will try to kayak one day on the river. I may do the Kampot pepper farm tour if there is time, but thats not a must do for me. 719 Head back to the 120F desert I call home I think getting a early morning bus makes the most sense.

I'm 24M from Canada and just finished uni, so this is my version of a graduation trip before I start looking for work. I planned it all pretty last minute (in fact I still have to book some flights for the last leg), and honestly I was hoping to find a friend to go with, but no one was available since most of my friends graduate in April, or are already working.\n\n***Reviewing my Trip so Far***\n\nI'm currently on day 20 of my 34-day trip. So far I've done Vietnam, Thailand, and now just finished a 10-day trek in Nepal. I absolutely loved my week in Vietnam, although it helped that I was visiting a friend who lived there. The weather was incredible (it was -15C when I left Toronto), and the streets just felt so alive, food was delicious and cheap, and there was coffee and fruit smoothies on every corner. People were also extremely friendly and I felt completely safe the whole time. I was only in Thailand for a couple days so can't really give honest feedback, but I enjoyed Wat Arun, and I was still very full of excitement for the trip. Trekking in Nepal was a whole experience. I went in without much research, and luckily chose a good guide. Saw absolutely incredible mountain views, struggled against high altitude (up to 5000m), and experienced the local Tibetan\/Tamang\/Himalayan culture which was totally unique to me. The hygiene situation was an eye-opener for me, and required a lot of open-mindedness and courage on my part (outdoor squat toilets, bucket showers, no soap, re-using all clothing).\n\nBut trekking in Nepal also had brought a lot of negative emotions - I went during the off-season, so the villages were nearly empty, and I met very few other tourists along the way. During the non-trekking hours, I was gripped by crushing loneliness and FOMO - thinking about what all my friends at home were doing, whether there was anyone I could even reach out to, and worrying about how I didn't have much of a life to return to at home. Wi-Fi was also very spotty and infrequent. It doesn't help that this was a huge life transition period for me - leaving behind my uni friends and moving back to my home city, with little community and no job lined up. Journalling helped a bit, and I've also been vlogging my experience (although I haven't had a chance to edit anything together yet). By the end of the trek, I couldn't fully enjoy the experience since I was counting down the days until I could leave.\n\n***Current struggle with lonliness, anxiety and burnout***\n\nI just got back from the trek, and still have a few days in Kathmandu before I fly out to Thailand. My head is kind of spinning, and I can't seem to catch my breath, even though the air here is 50% higher than what I'm adjusted to. I still need to decide my itinerary for the rest of the trip, and book tickets and accomodations.\n\nThe problem is, I don't know how I can enjoy the rest of my trip when I just feel so lonely, overwhelmed, and scared of regretting spending all this time and money. I really wish I had someone to experience this whole trip with - and it hurts and makes me feel inadequate knowing that I don't have such a person in my life.\n\nI also can't believe my trip is already 60% over. I really want to make the most of this trip and remember it with no regrets. But I already sort of regret having spent so much of this trip feeling lonely in Nepal.\n\n***Suggestions for planning the last leg of the trip?***\n\nMy plan for the last leg of this trip is flying from Nepal to Thailand, spending a few days in Bangkok hopefully at a hostel, then taking a sleeper train + high-speed rail to Laos (specifically Luang Prabang), then ending the trip in Japan.\n\nI'm hoping that staying in hostels will help with the loneliness by giving me an opportunity to meet other travellers. I'm a bit shy\/introverted by nature but I have no problems making friends as long as there's a space specifically for people to meet. Speaking of, does anyone have any recommendations for hostels in Bangkok or Luang Prabang that are good for meeting friends to hang out with and do day trips with? I'm not a party person, just looking for people to chill with, go to restaurants, and hopefully do day trips.\n\nI would also appreciate any advice in general about coping with feelings of loneliness and anxiety, and how to prevent it from ruining your solo trip.\n\nThank you!","subreddit_name":"solotravel","title":"Over Halfway through First Solo Trip in SEA + Nepal - Dealing with Loneliness, Anxiety and Burnout?","upvote_ratio":0.64,"mentioned_countries":"vietnam, thailand, nepal, laos, japan","mentioned_cities":"bangkok, kathmandu","date_only":"2025-02-12T00:00:00.000","time_only":"11:28:38","day_of_week":2,"month":2,"year":2025,"is_weekend":0,"weekday_name":"Wednesday","cleaned_caption":"Hi everyone, just hoping to share my current experience solotravelling and get advice from people who have felt similar experiences with loneliness and burnout during solo travel.

I'm 24M from Canada and just finished uni, so this is my version of a graduation trip before I start looking for work. I planned it all pretty last minute (in fact I still have to book some flights for the last leg), and honestly I was hoping to find a friend to go with, but no one was available since most of my friends graduate in April, or are already working.\n\n***Reviewing my Trip so Far***\n\nI'm currently on day 20 of my 34-day trip. So far I've done Vietnam, Thailand, and now just finished a 10-day trek in Nepal. I absolutely loved my week in Vietnam, although it helped that I was visiting a friend who lived there. The weather was incredible (it was -15C when I left Toronto), and the streets just felt so alive, food was delicious and cheap, and there was coffee and fruit smoothies on every corner. People were also extremely friendly and I felt completely safe the whole time. I was only in Thailand for a couple days so can't really give honest feedback, but I enjoyed Wat Arun, and I was still very full of excitement for the trip. Trekking in Nepal was a whole experience. I went in without much research, and luckily chose a good guide. Saw absolutely incredible mountain views, struggled against high altitude (up to 5000m), and experienced the local Tibetan\/Tamang\/Himalayan culture which was totally unique to me. The hygiene situation was an eye-opener for me, and required a lot of open-mindedness and courage on my part (outdoor squat toilets, bucket showers, no soap, re-using all clothing).\n\nBut trekking in Nepal also had brought a lot of negative emotions - I went during the off-season, so the villages were nearly empty, and I met very few other tourists along the way. During the non-trekking hours, I was gripped by crushing loneliness and FOMO - thinking about what all my friends at home were doing, whether there was anyone I could even reach out to, and worrying about how I didn't have much of a life to return to at home. Wi-Fi was also very spotty and infrequent. It doesn't help that this was a huge life transition period for me - leaving behind my uni friends and moving back to my home city, with little community and no job lined up. Journalling helped a bit, and I've also been vlogging my experience (although I haven't had a chance to edit anything together yet). By the end of the trek, I couldn't fully enjoy the experience since I was counting down the days until I could leave.\n\n***Current struggle with lonliness, anxiety and burnout***\n\nI just got back from the trek, and still have a few days in Kathmandu before I fly out to Thailand. My head is kind of spinning, and I can't seem to catch my breath, even though the air here is 50% higher than what I'm adjusted to. I still need to decide my itinerary for the rest of the trip, and book tickets and accomodations.\n\nThe problem is, I don't know how I can enjoy the rest of my trip when I just feel so lonely, overwhelmed, and scared of regretting spending all this time and money. I really wish I had someone to experience this whole trip with - and it hurts and makes me feel inadequate knowing that I don't have such a person in my life.\n\nI also can't believe my trip is already 60% over. I really want to make the most of this trip and remember it with no regrets. But I already sort of regret having spent so much of this trip feeling lonely in Nepal.\n\n***Suggestions for planning the last leg of the trip?***\n\nMy plan for the last leg of this trip is flying from Nepal to Thailand, spending a few days in Bangkok hopefully at a hostel, then taking a sleeper train + high-speed rail to Laos (specifically Luang Prabang), then ending the trip in Japan.\n\nI'm hoping that staying in hostels will help with the loneliness by giving me an opportunity to meet other travellers. I'm a bit shy\/introverted by nature but I have no problems making friends as long as there's a space specifically for people to meet. Speaking of, does anyone have any recommendations for hostels in Bangkok or Luang Prabang that are good for meeting friends to hang out with and do day trips with?

Then ill have a month solo. I've solo travelled a lot (4 months and then lots of smaller trips of around a week)  and I do enjoy the aspect of having to meet people and make friends and I love meeting and speaking to new people. However, realistically I am not that good at it. I'm not socially gifted, I'm fairly quiet and reserved. This is all fine and I don't think its that awful to be this way. But it does mean I tend to like to gravitate towards backpacker spots, places there are a lot of people and so more chance I will find some people I get on with. And I'm also into slow travelling when I am by myself and getting to know an area. I love place I can spend a week or two in. On my last trip I fell in love with panglao in the philippines. Weird one I know but it was somewhere I could just be for quite a while. The people were lovely and I could just explore. Similarly I enjoyed the vibes in siargao (although I have no need to party that much) and also kuta, lombok in indonesia. \n\nI guess I am asking for two pieces of advice.\n\nWhat route might you suggested for 2 and a half weeks in guatamala? We don't want to rush things but also will not be slow travelling at this point. My friend loves to party but equally likes doing activies. \n\nAnd secondly, where am I best to go after guatamala?

Ive traveled to 3 of these countries before and it has always been absolutely incredible, Japan, Thailand, and Cambodia were some of the highlights of my life so far. However now that Im here in Japan again, but solo this time I cant shake this hollow feeling. The main reason I booked this trip was to grow as a person, and truly learn to love my own company. However it seems to have had the opposite effect so far. Whenever Ive been out doing things, I just find myself wishing I could be experiencing them with someone else. Everything has felt overwhelming, and making decisions every single day and trying to plan things as I go has really drained me. This has never happened to me on my previous travels, I guess I didnt think that going solo would be too much different.

I climbed the Kamondo stairs in order to get to the Galata Tower. Even though it was first built in 528 during Justinians rule, the Crusaders destroyed the Galata Tower and rebuilt it in its current form in 1349 in the Romanesque style.

In the 7th floor, you are greeted with a model of Istanbul and in the 8th floor, you are greeted with the observation deck.

Im trying to keep my budget for everything below 8k and that seems to be my total higher end estimate for this trip including France. Im tempted to try and make it cheaper by about 1k by either shaving off 1.5 weeks from Japan or 1 week in France. Should I try and save some money or is it worth it to spend time in both. The 3 weeks in japan will be in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Hokkaido. For reference Ive never been out of the US","sentiment_score":0.6249},{"submission_id":"1jjsbwk","author":"Away-Citron703","created_utc":"2025-03-25T19:44:39.000Z","month_year":"03-2025","name":"t3_1jjsbwk","num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"I would like to go backpacking next year in June for 2 months in Thailand Vietnam and Laos we would be doing it in a 4 what do I need to buy?,is it better to go with a company or just freestyle it?,how much?

Im hoping to meet new people, share experiences, and learn from others whove already made the move or are living there now! Any help or advice you can share would be greatly appreciated. Im eager to start this adventure and need as much information as possible to make it happen smoothly.

I am planning an extensive around the world trip. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be going this autumn\/winter or next year - it all depends on how much I\u2019ll save up this year. \n\nI seek advice and help for the trip overall but also for individual destinations and to know how long I should stay to get the experience I\u2019m hoping for. Would love to know what your itineraries was for the trip or if you can recommend excursions or landmarks to see\/not see? And also how long you recommend me staying in each country? I don\u2019t want to plan too much and too tight as my plan is to stay an extra day(s) if I like the place or move on if the opposite.\n\nI\u2019ll start in\nMadagascar(for experiencing the unique nature and wildlife)->\n\nTanzania(going on a safari and also to visit Zanzibar and learn how to surf)->\n\nSeychelles(I imagine the islands to have nice bounty beaches but not much else to do so I\u2019ll probably only spend a few days here?)->\n\nSri Lanka(to just chill out and surf and learn to skateboard as well - in need of personal recommendations)->\n\nNepal(would love to see a witch doctor and channel some spirituality and go hiking)->\n\n\u2018Banana pancake trail\u2019\/Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, maybe also Malaysia?, Singapore(only for a few days as I\u2019ve already been), Indonesia & Philippines(this is for the culture and see temples but also spend time on the beach and experience the proper rookie backpacker experience)->\n\nSouth Korea(experience culture and the whole futuristic society vibe)->\n\nJapan(same as above but would also love to see the countryside and experience the serenity that the big screen always sell us)->\n\nSailing as a \u2018guest\u2019 on a boat in the pacific(I don\u2019t know the specific term for it but where I\u2019m from it\u2019s a thing to pay for being a guest on a smaller boat and then you do work on the boat together with others. It\u2019s very popular to do in the pacific to see the countries and islands from the water and \u2018easily\u2019 going from one to the other)->\n\nAustralia(planning to stay here for a while. Would like to seek out a community to experience bbq on the beach and surfing and skateboarding etc. have been thinking about farm work and ranching really interest me although I have 0 experience. Would love to learn how to ride a horse and be a ranch hand but I think it\u2019s difficult to get that offered with no experience.. besides that I would love to road trip(I know conditions and distance is crazy) and also see the west side)->\n\nNew Zealand(same as above. Would love a road trip and seeing Hobbiton)\n\nSome additional information: I do work in the aviation industry and I do have some quite good discounts on plane tickets. Unfortunately these advantages will stop after 6 months of unemployment so please disregard this in my choice of budget.\n\nI will be travelling solo as I want the full \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 experience. I have been working abroad in different destinations for a few years so although I haven\u2019t backpacked I know the vibe and what to be aware of.\n\nMy overall plan is to seek people out in airports, hostels, on excursions, at a job I might pick up etc in order to be social and feel like I am travelling with somebody. Just for me to feel safe but also because I am a very extroverted person. My biggest wish for this trip is to get loads of experiences and see wonderful things but an even bigger wish is to have people to share it with(and I don\u2019t mean people at home ofc).

Im not in my early twenties anymore and do sometimes feel the need to be alone. FYI Im truly sorry but I havent started planning or researching anything. I know most people plan and research and THEN ask for second opinions on Reddit but I would like to get your recommendations from the beginning. Thats part 1of 2 of my trip so Ill start with that thank you so much in advance!!!","sentiment_score":0.9992},{"submission_id":"1j8kb2o","author":"GearPuzzleheaded7317","created_utc":"2025-03-11T06:14:55.000Z","month_year":"03-2025","name":"t3_1j8kb2o","num_comments":4,"score":0,"selftext":"Backpacking through Cambodia is like stepping into a vivid tapestry of history, culture, and natural beauty.

This is going to be my first time, leaving the country!! Id love to hear your recommendations for things to do in those 72 hours before my main trip begins. What are some must see spots or activities in Kuta? After Bali, Ill be heading to Thailand for about 10 days, visiting Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and then off to the beautiful Phi Phi Islands for another week. Im also contemplating a quick 3day trip to Vietnam. Is it worth it? Since Im traveling solo my husband isnt interested in this part of Asia, Im looking for tips on solo travel, safety, and any experiences youve had. Lastly, Im torn between bringing a roll suitcase or a giant backpack. What do you think would be more practical for this trip?

I have a trip planned to Indonesia and I was planning to be there for nearly three months 83 days . However, looking at visa requirements, I would require a visarun outside of the country in order to continue the last 3 weeks. That would cost me about 150 CAD if I were to do a visarun to Malaysia return flight and visa included IF I book my flight now . That being said, I had a flight already booked from Indonesia to Seoul on my way home on day 83. But that flight has been cancelled and I have been given the option to for free either rebook for another day or cancel the flight completely. That came at a fortuitous time because now Im conflicted. Ive spoken to a few people whove been to Indonesia and theyve told me 60 days was enough Ive already spent a month in Lombok last year and Ive spoken to other people who are in Indonesia and theyve told me that three months is not enough. Ive already been to Malaysia although Im open to returning loved it there Im not interested in going to the Philippines or Sri Lanka or any of the surrounding countries and Ive pretty much seen the rest of Southeast Asia. My question is, if you were me, what would you do? Would you cancel that flight to Seoul, leave Indonesia after 60 days, and stay in another country for 3 weeks before Seoul? Or would you do a visarun and just rebook the flight to Seoul a day or 2 ahead ? I already have a flight booked to go back to Canada fork Seoul about a 5 days later Also, where else would you go in Indonesia? My plan right now was to start in Jakarta where my flight lands I want to go stargazing because apparently theres a really good clear sky at certain moments in certain places on Java. And then I want to go hiking the two volcanoes that are in Java. 1 week And then I want to make my way to Bali for two weeks exploring, meditation and then the Gili Islands for 3 weeks scuba diving and then Lombok for one week surfing and Suwalesi and Flores for the remaining weeks before I would fly back out from Jakarta. Exploring Now, for that plan, is 2 months sufficient or will I want to come back to Indonesia after doing a visarun or should I just go explore another surrounding country for those 3 weeks I would have left? Please bear in mind that Im a solo female traveler who is reaching the end of her extended solo trip and my funds are now limited so I would rather do the most costeffective option but also enjoy the last 34 weeks of my travels before I head back home to work. I really appreciate any feedback from those whove been to Indonesia or are planning to. Thanks so much !

We've got a serious case of wanderlust and are eager to dive into the heart of Central America.\n\nBefore this, we embarked on a thrilling two-month escapade in Thailand earlier this year. Our journey started in bustling Bangkok, where we found a home in the heart of Chinatown. Little did we know that we'd make a lifelong friend there. He was the owner of a charming restaurant, keeping alive a cherished family tradition passed down through generations. At the age of 70-80, he had some incredible stories to share.\n\nFrom Bangkok, we headed to the  Sai Yok National Park, where we spent three  nights surrounded by nature's wonders.
