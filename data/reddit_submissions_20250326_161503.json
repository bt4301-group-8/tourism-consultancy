        "selftext": "Hi All!\n\nI was wondering if you could share some unique activities that can only be done in Spain. In my research I have only found watching a flamenco dancing and bull fighting show. I would avoid the bull fighting for obvious reasons. So the only unique activity I've found thus far the flamenco dancing show.\n\nContext: I am thinking of traveling to Spain in August but I am struggling to find enough unique activities to occupy a week of vacation there. I'm trying to find strong reasons to visit Spain, but I'm having a hard time doing so.\n\nI'm not interested in site seeing. So I'm not interested in seeing the architecture, going to museums, etc... I would go to points of interest while I'm in Spain, but it's honestly not a core interest of mine.\n\nI love trying new and unique foods and cuisines in other countries but I believe I won't have many options in Spain since I'm vegetarian. I'm aware there are some options like tapas, but I'm not sure if Spain's vegetarian tapas is a strong reason to visit.  I also don't drink, so wine tasting isn't something I can do either.\n\nI do enjoy doing generic activities like hiking, kayaking, etc... in general but when I'm visiting a new country I would want to do unique activities that are specific to that country instead. For example going to the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, going to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, etc... The main unique activities I found for Spain are seeing a flamenco dancing and bull fighting show. So it would be great to know if there are more unique activities to do that can only be done in Spain.\n\nI really want to find more reasons to visit Spain since I hear so many great things about the country! So I'd be grateful to hear what unique activities people have done there. Thanks!",

We may spend a week in Tokyo, but not in the highest touristy areas, since we\u2019ve seen them already. We prefer just 2-3 locations and doing day trips and exploring around where we are.  If you\u2019ve been there in the winter and spent time in smaller cities, where would you recommend basing ourselves for the time there? Would it be too hard to get around from a more rural location? Moderate budget, nothing too fancy, prefer places with airbnb type accommodations so we can cook a bit vs just hotel room.  Thanks!",

        "selftext": "I just spent about 16 days in Colombia with my partner and wanted to get my thoughts out about the trip. I hate saying it, but I don\u2019t think I enjoyed the trip as much as I expected. I still had lots of fun, but found the trip to be a bit exhausting at times. I\u2019d describe it overall as dynamic, with lots of ups and downs. I'm wondering if other people can relate, give advice, or have recs for some other places I should try traveling to! Sorry this ended up so long. \n\nTL;DR - Colombia was a pretty intense trip. I loved the local people and some travelers, the food, and the nature, but found it to be somewhat overwhelming. It wasn't too expensive, but I found myself regretting various bookings or purchases throughout the trip. Wondering if I am not outgoing enough for the country, but overall still had a great time. \n\nAnyways, here are the positives to start:\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\nNATURE\n\nEje Cafetero is probably the most beautiful place I\u2019ve seen in my life. Combined with the wildlife in Tayrona and Playa Brava (I highly recommend Playa Brava over San Juan) the outdoors here were just astounding. As a wonderful man in Munich once said to me, \u201cMy heart goes out to \\[insert place\\].\u201d For me that place was Salento. Even if it didn\u2019t have the amazing Valle de Cocora, the rolling hills and tall grass here are things to marvel at and enjoy the serenity in. Extremely happy we spent a decent chunk of time here. Plus, there were tons of beautiful birds to watch.\u00a0\n\nPEOPLE\n\nBoth Colombian people and many of the travelers we met were some of the nicest people I\u2019ve met on a trip. It was easier for me to approach people and start conversations than probably any other place for me except maybe the Camino de Santiago. When I spoke with our hostel hosts in Spanish, they were always patient, kind, and very willing to help me practice. This part of Colombian culture truly stands out. People almost always meet you with a smile and you feel the warmth of the people around you.\u00a0\n\nFOOD\n\nMany people seem to complain about the food, but I actually liked quite a few of the meals we had. It took some time to find the rights spots here and there, but when we did, the freshness and simplicity was great. Lean into eating sopa, lots of juice, and chicharron. The menu del dia was our friend and we could often split one. Plus, the coffee was fantastic, cheap, and didn\u2019t give me jitters. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s what happened (could be a lot of Robusta coffee at the shops back home?).\u00a0\n\nHOSTELS (some of them)\n\nYambolombia in Salento may be my favorite hostel ever. It\u2019s 30 minutes out of town walking, but the atmosphere and tranquility were unmatched. Plus it is cheap, the people are incredibly kind, and you can walk to the coffee fincas very easily from there. The Valle Tayrona hostel was probably the coolest hostel I\u2019ve seen. You\u2019re kinda in a jungle and everything is made of bamboo and it\u2019s eco friendly.\u00a0\n\nMEDELLIN\n\nMedellin again felt somewhat chaotic for me, but I found it to be very cool. An amazing mix of history, cool neighborhoods, and loving people. We stayed near Laureles and I think that was my favorite area to wander. I recommend seeing Comuna 13, doing a walking tour of the Centro, checking out some museums, and just meandering. The Centro felt a bit sketchy at times, but nothing too crazy. Just watch yourself, don't stand in sketchy areas too long, and listen to the locals if they tell you not to hang out somewhere. \n\n**NEGATIVES**\n\nI want to preface this by saying that none of this is a reflection on the country of Colombia or its people, but rather a reflection of my experience and possibly some ill-founded expectations. There\u2019s also a factor of comparison involved. A year ago my partner and I went to Japan where we found nearly everything to be extremely convenient and orderly, which made our trip relaxing but also exciting as we got to focus more on fun rather than figuring things out. I speak some Spanish which helped a ton, but I definitely felt out of control for decent chunks of this trip.\u00a0\n\nWEALTH DISPARITY\n\nThis is just something that felt a little strange, especially in Cartagena and Medell\u00edn. It\u2019s also my first time in a country with this much poverty, so that has an impact. Flying into Cartagena, the first thing we saw was comunas that looked very poor. I felt a bit odd in this very touristy area while knowing this isn\u2019t the reality for most people living there. In Medell\u00edn, people talked about taking cable cars over poor neighborhoods. This could be powerful for understanding, but also could easily go in a very bad direction. These issues aren\u2019t unique to Colombia, but it was new for me. I did appreciate that it seemed like the government of Medell\u00edn was trying to improve many things. I don\u2019t live there so I can\u2019t comment, but that was the revitalization energy expressed in many tours.\u00a0\n\nCARTAGENA\n\nCartagena is a beautiful city (at least the small part that I saw), but it was sadly one of my least favorites cities I\u2019ve visited. It\u2019s extremely touristy, relatively expensive, and very hot. The streets in the walled city are so beautiful, I just wish they would shut some of them down to most traffic. The sidewalks are too small to walk next to someone and it can feel like you have to dodge stuff frequently. There are also constantly people asking you to buy things. I underestimated how much energy this would take out of me. With all that said, Cartagena at 6am when it\u2019s quiet is a beautiful place. Plus, I highly recommend doing a snorkeling tour with the company Diving Planet if you\u2019re willing to pay a bit more than the other Rosario tours. Easily a highlight of the trip for us and we didn\u2019t want a party boat at 9am (or at all really). One last thing, we did a tour that included going to Alquimico and found it to be very overrated. Getseman\u00ed was much cooler IMO.\u00a0\n\nPRICES\n\nColombia is by no means expensive, but I found that the prices of things ranged dramatically and were generally higher than I anticipated. Sometimes you\u2019d have nearly 10x buying power from the US. Other times things would cost the same. Anything with liquor was usually pretty rough. I also found it a bit harder to find quality budget options than in some other countries.\n\nI didn\u2019t fully realize this beforehand, but the frequent need for guides was a major expense. Even free tours asked to tip about the same I was asked in Europe, which I did. It felt like in order to do many of the fun things, you had to be willing to put down more cash than I expected. We wanted to see Barbas Bremen near Filandia but skipped it altogether because you had to have a guide and it was like $40 USD minimum per person from what I saw in about 30 minutes of searching. I get why they do it, but it was frustrating all the same.\n\nColombia was still quite cheap overall, just more expensive than I thought. These things combined to follow what some of our travel buddies often said: \u201cthe money flows like water here.\u201d\n\nNOISE\n\nPeople often said to us that Colombians like things very loud. Idk if that\u2019s universally the case, but it was definitely the experience we had a lot of the time. I don\u2019t necessarily love the near absolute silence of Japan\u2019s transit system, but I didn\u2019t always appreciate people playing music or videos aloud in tight spaces or in transit. Music in restaurants and bars often made it hard to talk with people, I lost my voice a lot, and my partner couldn\u2019t handle the volume period in certain places. This just wore us down over time.\u00a0\n\nSCAMS AND VALUE\n\nIn Cartagena especially, we felt like we were getting *sort of* scammed a lot. Not like \u201coh we paid for a futbol game but they sold our ticket to someone else,\u201d but more like we\u2019d be rushed into a taxi, our shuttle to Santa Marta dropped us at a random spot filled with local taxis, the guide we bought was definitely not worth the price, etc. Much of this could have been remedied with more research, but I found many online guides for Colombia to be either outdated or inaccurate. Get Your Guide seems very hit or miss (even with very good ratings) and generally too expensive, but it was definitely harder for me to figure things out on my own here than other countries. Much of the time when we asked our hostel for help, they would direct us to tours that were just as, if not more expensive than Get Your Guide. If you want a solid online guide, I highly recommend checking out Tom Plan My Trip. It had some of the best info for us the entire journey.\u00a0\n\nTOURISTS VS TRAVELERS\u00a0\n\nThere were a number of people we spent multiple days with and had a good time. Outside of these amazing groups, the tourist scene seemed very party focused. In Cartagena basically every customs booth has signs about illegal sex trafficking and sex tourism. Many people also just want to travel and get drunk, which is fine, but that wasn\u2019t really our vibe. This may have been a big factor in why we didn\u2019t super enjoy Cartagena. We met some great people, but the Viajero hostel was definitely a big party hostel. Being a party hostel is fine, but Hostelworld rankings in Colombia seem a bit skewed towards that style, so atmosphere ratings may need deeper consideration for some travelers. We had better luck later in the trip picking less popular, cheaper hostels (I was sort of kicking myself for not remembering this earlier). \n\nAn annoying side note - Viajero Cartagena was charging 60,000 COP for a pub crawl that very well could have been free if they just allowed people to go and buy drinks on their own. I heard the first stop on the crawl was another Viajero which just feels like another *sort of* scam like I mentioned above. I recommend going to Palenque in Getseman\u00ed for free instead. \n\nIf people wanted to party, I\u2019d hoped there\u2019d be more people who wanted to grab a six pack and go sit on the wall of the walled city or find a place in a park. Then go to a club or bar after. Many people seemed perfectly happy to empty their wallets with watered-down $10 cocktails and overpriced pub crawls.\u00a0Maybe I just picked the wrong hostel :(\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nColombia felt a bit challenging as a couple who has some introverted tendencies. I try to push my comfort zone while traveling and I think I did okay, but the party scene is everywhere. I still feel incredibly lucky to have met the people we did.\u00a0\n\nAt the end of the day, I will remember the people and the nature. I would come back to Colombia, but maybe visit some smaller towns in the pacific or Santander, or maybe try Bogot\u00e1. I can\u2019t tell if Colombian city culture was just too much for me. I tend to take things too seriously so it\u2019s a good challenge for me to step back like this, but I\u2019ve heard so many people rave about the country, I began to wonder if I wasn\u2019t outgoing enough for it. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s something wrong with me or if it just wasn\u2019t the right energy for my personality. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s much I can do about that except continue trying to be open to new experiences.\u00a0\n\nAnyways, thank you Colombia for the wonderful experience.\u00a0I'd probably give the trip a 7.5/10.",

However, it is practically impossible to find anywhere in Singapore to exchange Singapore dollars into local currency.  And I'm pretty sure there are no money exchange places in these countries that would accept Singapore dollars either.  \n\nSo I'll probably need to exchange for an intermediary currency first before I fly over, and then exchange for local currency there.  May I know what's the best currency for this? \n\nI was initially thinking of US dollar.  But for some reason money exchange outlets seem to be particularly strict with US dollar bills.  There were multiple times in the past where my US dollar bill was rejected because it's 'tainted' for some reason.  So instead of US dollars, maybe Euros or even RMB would be a better choice? How fair are the exchange rates of currencies other than US dollars in South America?",

        "selftext": "Hey!\n\nTL;DR: I arrive to India on April 16th but my 30-day tourist e-Visa first entry must be before April 15th. Can I apply for a new visa? If so, when?\n\nMy wife an I are traveling to Bhutan (via Delhi) on April 11th. We are flying back to Delhi from Bhutan on April 16th and staying for a couple of days in India before flying back to our country.\n\nI applied for our 30-day tourist e-Visas on March 16th and set our estimated arrival date to April 11th, as that was our expected arrival date. Both applications were approved in less than 24 hours and, to my surprise, the email communicating the approval said the following:\n\n* First Entry must be on or before : April 15th,2025\n\nThis is not mentioned anywhere (at least that I could see) in the application process or FAQs, but it seems that you have a maximum of 30 days to enter India since your application date. This is the root of my problem, as you will see now.\n\nSince our e-Visas were approved, our flight from Delhi to Bhutan was moved forward by 2 hours, so our transit time in Delhi has been severely shortened and we are at risk of not making it in time for our connection.\n\nTo help us out, our travel agent spoke with the Bhutanese airline and they will be waiting for us at our arrival gate in Delhi to escort us to our connecting flight without going through immigration. Because of this, our first entry in India will be on our returning flight on April 16th (off by one day :cry:)\n\nI've reached out to the e-Visa helpdesk both via email and phone, but they have constantly repeated the same sentences like robots and refused to provide any more information or try to understand my situation. Below is the only excerpt from our lengthy email chain that was somewhat useful:\n\n* If you want to apply for a new 30-day\u00a0e-Visa, you can apply after the expiry of the current\u00a0e-Visa\u00a0or You can fill out the application at least 4 days before (minimum duration to apply for this\u00a0visa) from the date of arrival.\u00a0E-Visa\u00a0will take 72 hours to process after the completion of your application.\n\nI'm not sure I fully understand what they mean, because the condition after the \"or\" completely invalidates the first one.\n\nI also called them on the phone to try to clarify it and I think I understood that I can apply for a new e-Visa on April 11th (4 days before the existing one expires). Again, not too sure if that's exactly what they said because they had a very thick accent and were really annoyed when I politely asked them to please speak slower.\n\nSo, at this point, these are the options that I see:\n\n1. Go through immigration on April 11th and risk missing our flight.\n2. Apply for a new e-Visa at midnight April 16th and hope that it gets approved fast.\n3. Apply for a new e-Visa on April 11th and hope that what I understood on the phone is correct and it gets approved.\n4. Some knowledgeable traveler from reddit helps me out by providing a reliable 4th option.\n\nI would love to hear your experiences and hopefully informed opinions on the matter. Thank you!",

Nothing major, just going with the flow and trying to enjoy the good food and relax after the flight.\n\nTuesday, 4/15 - TAIPEI\n\nTry to hit the main attractions - Elephant Mountain hike in the morning, check out Chiang Kai-Shek memorial, Taipei 101, and maybe ending the night at a night market for dinner\n\nWednesday, 4/16 - --> CHIAYI to FENQIHU\n\nTake an early morning train to Chiayi and from there to Fenqihu. Enjoy the forest vibes.\n\nThursday, 4/17 -> ALISHAN\n\nGo up to Alishan and walk some trails.\n\nFriday, 4/18 - ALISHAN -> TAIPEI\n\nWake up for an early sunrise, walk around, and then head back to Taipei for the evening.\n\nSaturday, 4/19 - TAIPEI/JIUFEN\n\nChill in Taipei and head out to Jiufen for the evening, coming back at night.\n\nSunday, 4/20 - TAIPEI\n\nLast night in Taipei\n\nMonday, 4/21 - Leave\n\nHave a breakfast and then head back to the airport\n\n  \nWhat do you all think? I am only going to be in the country for a week, so I'm trying not to pack too much. At the same time, I am not exactly the type of person who feels the need to see every facet of a site or town. My biggest question is regarding that Wednesday - a whole day in Chiayi/Fenqihu may seem to be too much according to some, yet others say that it is worth it.

        "selftext": "As promised in the previous post, seems like you guys like it so I am gonna do another on on South Korea. For those arriving from Europe or North America, you guys will be at Terminal 1 Seoul Incheon International Airport ( unless you fly with Korean Air as they operate exclusively out of Terminal 2). Seoul has two airports: Seoul Incheon- an international hub and Seoul Gimpo ( mostly serves domestic and regional flight to China, Japan or Taiwan). I basically have only two advice: download 'Klook' and a South Korean navigation map called 'Naver Map'.\n\nFor the sake of seamless travel, you would need stable internet connection right? Who could survive these days without internet connection? Go to Klook and type in Sim/Card pick up in Incheon Airport. You then need to select the right time and terminal from which you can redeem the Sim/Card from Korea Telekom. Just go straight to their counters at the arrival area and you will see a bunch of those. When I did this trip in July 2024, I got unlimited data in 5 days for just under $25 and it was really good. Klook also offers pretty reasonably priced day trip to Nami Island which is like 1h30 away from downtown Seoul. Speaking of transportation to downtown Seoul, you can take the express train from either terminals in Seoul Incheon. Again, it is available on Klook. As of today, the Arex service is only $8 on my Klook account. Don't waste money for a taxi if you are on a tight budget since Seoul Incheon is like a 90-minute drive from downtown Seoul. \n\nIf you want to get a genuine experience of Seoul, go to the open-air local market such as Namdaemun to try topokki or some other local delicacies. I swear there are a ton of those and they are top-notch food with very affordable prices. You could also visit the tourist areas such as Myeongdong (a street full of food carts and gift shop), Itaewon or Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you think of what to bring home as a gift, I would recommend to purchase cosmetics from Olive Young ( a cosmetic giant in South Korea) or some domestically produced red ginseng products. If you want some unique Korean food, go to the GS25 or CU convenience store. You will be amazed by how much food they have to offer. (TRY THE YONSEI CAKE AS IT IS STUFFED WITH A LOT OF CREAM INSIDE ITS SO GOODDDDDDD). Also, sign up for one of their art shows and I guarantee you will like it. \n\nAt last, if you want to visit a theme park like Disneyland in the US, Everland is for you. I have to reiterate it but it is on Klook as well. And if you are done with Seoul, you can go the the Seoul Central Station and purchase a high-speed rail ticket to Busan. Or if you have time, you can go to Jeju island which is also equally interesting as visiting Seoul. There, you get to see the dormant volcano. Fun fact: Seoul-Jeju is the busiest domestic route in the world which I think is because of the fact that a lot of city dwellers in Seoul seek a peaceful getaway within their country to wind down AND Jeju island turns out to be the right place.\n\nThat pretty much wraps up my South Korea review guys. I hope it provides you guys with the exhaustive view of what and how to do it properly. I know I mentioned a lot of Klook but the app is that good as it has saved me a ton of money and makes me hassle-free. If I my upvotes hit 1000 I will do another blog called:' Singapore in a nutshell'. Thanks for bearing with me till this point. See y'all later.",

        "selftext": "Hi,  \nI did make a previous post that I got lucky that I got a flight voucher from American airlines. It expires in a year and I'd figure I'd do a small solo trip before I go to Vietnam. My budget is around 500-700 usd for the week (not including airfare), but if I can go lower that be nice.\n\nI am debating between if I should go to Peru or Colombia. I have some travel experience, my most recent one being in Morocco. I am concerned that I could get mugged/robbed in Colombia. However, I do have interest in seeing Colombia. If I did Peru, I would do the Amazon rainforest as that is a bucket list of mine but I am unsure how much it would be or which part of the Peruvian Amazon I should visit. I am also unsure if a week is enough for either country.\n\nI am interested in coasts/islands, but I also like the idea of going into the jungle/doing the lost city trek (in Colombia). I have interest in seeing the various insects and arthropods, but this necessary. I will assume that this is the only time I will be able to visit South America. I did hear that Leticia, Colombia is close to the Amazon rainforest, but I am unsure how it is compared to the Amazon in Peru. I recently heard of Peru hop, but I am unsure if it is worth doing that (I am in my early/mid 20s). \n\nMy Spanish skills are frankly crap, but I seem to remember some Spanish from high school. For either country, what did you do for a week and how did it go? And if you went to the Amazon rainforest in Peru, which tour did you book and how was the experience? Or would you recommend I go elsewhere?\n\nTl;dr: I am unsure if I should pick between Colombia or Peru for a week trip. I have a flight voucher that will expire in a year. Interests are jungles, the insects, the coast. But if I saw other things like history that is also great. My Spanish skills are crap. Budget is \\~$500-700 but if I can go cheaper even better. ",

        "selftext": "Before you start typing about how I'm wrong and have no clue what I'm talking about, please read the entire post.\n\nI travel a lot for work and a lot for vacation compared to the average person. I have status on airlines, hotel chains, and car rental companies. \n\nFirst things first, UNLESS YOU'RE EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT AVIATION CONSUMER PROTECTIONS, ALWAYS BOOK FLIGHTS DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINE. NEVER USE THIRD PARTY SITES FOR FLIGHTS. The FAA has protections that are voided if booked through a third party.\n\nI see a lot of posts on reddit about how booking directly with the hotel is always the cheapest. This is wrong and the opposite from my actual experience both within the US and internationally. I book directly with hotels for work and almost exclusively use third party websites for personal travel.\n\nI've used many different sites to book hotels. Super.com, Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia, and more are common for me. \n\nWill hotels match those sites' prices? From my experience, rarely. Well what about price match guarantee? The price match that hotels use is a marketing tactic. If you read the terms and conditions for the guarantee, they make it virtually impossible for a price you find to qualify due to irrelevant reasons.\n\nThe single most important thing to look at when using third party sites is the final price. There are sometimes fees added on which can make it more expensive than originally thought. That doesn't mean it's not still cheaper than booking directly. Also make sure to look at cancellation terms and what room type you're getting. This is where most people don't pay attention and have regrets.\n\nI will admit they do try to scam you sometimes but you need to be smart. \n\nHere is one great example from a recent trip.\n\n3 nights, King Bed, near Seattle\nHampton Inn (Everett)\nBooking directly: $326 total\nBooking with Super.com: $241 total\n\nThe room was great and had a view of the water. No hassle at all.\n\nFor this booking, Super.com tried to sell me breakfast for $27 a night which is free at Hampton Inn. This is how they keep prices low. They sell you something you would get anyways. This doesn't always happen but is something to watch out for.\n\nI have diamond status at Hampton Inn but it still made more sense to book using a third party than direct. That doesn't mean there aren't benefits by booming directly. With many hotels, you can pick your room during mobile check in if you book directly. Since I'm usually looking for the best deal and a clean place to sleep, I don't worry about picking a room.\n\nI have taken trips across the United States, Europe, Iceland, and next week I'll be going to Japan for 2 weeks. Nearly every single time I book hotels, I use third party sites. Every single hotel in Japan in through Agoda except for one through Rakuten. They we're all substantially cheaper than booking directly. \n\nWith over 40 hotels, I've never had any issues with using third party sites either. I've read so many horror stories on Reddit about how the websites lie to you about which hotel you're actually getting or how they got the boiler room of the hotel because they didn't book directly. \n\nI just wanted to put my experiences out there since they've been different from what I've been reading.\n\nTLDR; Third Party Sites are almost always cheaper for travel if you pay attention to what you're getting and hotels don't actually care you didn't book directly.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone so i'm graduating this may from college and me plus some friends are planning a trip. Originally we were between cancun or punta cana but online a lot of people say it's not worth it so we kept looking and arrived at maybe Costa Rica. But still undecided, do you guys have any suggestions we're all in our early 20s looking for a place with. ice beaches and explore a bit. For reference our dream spot would be Philippines or Portugal but we find it to be way out of our budget of 2.5k (now of u guys have secret tips or gems for those places it would be awesome). So my question is within the caribbean region including costa rica, cancun, and punta cana is there a place that you recommend go as our last trip since we're moving away after college? \n\nall advice is very much appreciated!",

        "selftext": "I have found some tickets departing from London to Hong Kong via a third party website. However, it says the price does not include check in baggage but can have it for an extra \u00a3150 per passenger.\n\nNaturally I rang Cathay Pacific to enquire the cost of a check in baggage with them but purchasing tickets through a third party. What they said to me was that they have three types of tickets, Light, Essential and Flex. All types include 23kg check in baggage.\n\nMy question is if I purchase through the third party website at the default cost, are trying to pull a fast one by claiming check in bag is not included even though it is included by the airline for all ticket types.\n\nHoping someone with similar experience would be able to shed some light on this. For context, there are 4 passengers, so cost can add up quite quickly.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe just returned home (in Germany) from our crazy one-month trip in Asia. The Reddit community gave us very valuable tips before going, so we wanted to share some of our life hacks and things to keep in mind for traveling on a budget.\n\nBy traveling on a budget, I don't mean staying in shared rooms in cheap hostels, eating from convenience stores, or taking inconvenient (but cheap) transportation. Hopefully, this post will be very helpful to some of you who are going to one of the above countries soon.\n\n**Quick summary:**\n\n* 29 days in total. Departed on the 18th of February and returned on the 19th of March back home\n* 5 nights in Shanghai\n* 6 nights in Hong Kong\n* 2 nights in Beijing\n* 2 nights in Seoul\n* 12 nights in Japan\n\n**ACCOMMODATION:**\n\nFor a total of 27 nights, we stayed only 6 nights in hotels. 6 nights cost us ca. 180 Euros. For China, we used\u00a0Trip website\u00a0(3 nights, 3 cities, 3 hotels). I would highly encourage you to either avoid using\u00a0Trip whatsoever or to be very careful with the hotel chosen. Almost all of their reviews and pictures are fake.\n\nFor the other 21 nights, we got very lucky by organizing 3 (almost) consecutive exchanges using home exchanges in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Kyoto. I would highly encourage many of you to try the platform. We've been using it for almost 7 years and have stayed in so many different places. Even if we had booked the cheapest options in these three cities, it would have cost us a minimum of \u20ac 1.1K\n\n**TRANSPORT:**\n\n***Flights:***\n\n* There are direct flights from Germany (Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich) to China (our first point of arrival). These however cost at least \u20ac 500-600. Instead, we found direct flights for \u20ac 200 from Budapest, Hungary. We did have to take an additional flight to/from Budapest. Ongoing, we decided to arrive in Budapest 2 days before so we can also explore the city. For the return flight, we had to wait ca. 6 hours at the Budapest Airport, but in the end, it all worked out. This slight \"inconvenience\" resulted in savings of \u20ac 1.5K (including the additional costs to arrive in Budapest). We booked with\u00a0AirChina and I must admit both flights were very comfortable, with 2 meals per flight provided, and extra amenities.\n* Booking 2-3 months in advance is the ideal timeframe.\n* Also, oftentimes connecting flights are way cheaper than a direct flight. So you might wanna explore such options as well.\n* My first point of reference is ALWAYS skyscanner.com! Instead of checking for a specific city, I do research for the entire country. Once I find the best option, I go and book everything through the original website of the airline company. I NEVER book through intermediaries.\n* Once in Asia, we had 4 additional flights that we booked with SpringAirlines, AirChina, and JejuAir. Overall all ok, you get what you paid for. One very interesting thing about flights in Asia, oftentimes, is that the closer you are to the departure date, the cheaper the price! For example, we booked 3 months in advance Shanghai - Hong Kong with Spring Airlines. Paid ca. \u20ac 180 for both of us. 3 weeks before departing, I checked again, it would've cost us \u20ac 120.\n\n***TRAINS:***\n\n* We used trains only in Japan, more precisely the SHINKANSEN. So many times actually :)\n* Our trip to Japan was in west Japan (the area between Kyoto and Hiroshima). So we made use of the JR West Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass. We paid \u20ac 105 for a 5-day pass between Hiroshima and Kyoto. The Shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima is included in this price. Boy oh boy, we saved so much with this pass. We did: Day 1: Kyoto-Hiroshima, Day 2: Kyoto - Himeji - Kobe, Day 3: Kyoto - Kurashiki - Okayama, Day 4: Kyoto - Takamatsu (Shikoku Island), Day 5: Kyoto - Osaka. If booked individually, it would've cost us at least \u20ac 340 (I stopped calculating at one point). Main takeaway: Make use of the regional JR Passes, instead of the JR pass (it is not worth it at all!).\n\n***METRO:***\n\n* We used almost the whole time the metro. Metro in China is super cheap! Make use of it.\n\n**FOOD & SOUVENIRS:**\n\n* Food in China, was on average, the cheapest. There were days, where we spent ca.\u20ac 30 per day, 3 meals a day, transport including for the both of us. Install AliPay (you will definitely gonna need it). Almost every time, in every restaurant, if you book via AliPay, you will pay less (you get various discounts) compared to paying at the restaurant. The savings are sometimes even 50%! If you download the mini-app Meituan (within AliPay), you can get so many different discounts for food. Unfortunately, our Chinese is pretty bad, so we didn't use it.\n* For Seoul and for Japan, our budget was, on average, \u20ac 40 for both of us. Of course, the main thing we always do (a strict rule we have) is to avoid the touristy area. So we do a quick research on Google as to where to eat.\n* In general, for every country, AVOID restaurants where there is someone outside with a sign targeting customers. A good restaurant doesn't need that.\n\nTraveling doesn't have to be expensive. One just needs the time and dedication to explore the most cost-effective options when traveling. This is our 3rd year in a row visiting Asian countries, and we always organize longer journeys that include several countries. Visiting Japan from China would cost us an additional \u20ac 160 as opposed to taking a flight from Europe.\n\nAs a reference, last year we did a 1-month trip in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand which cost us ca. 3K.\n\nFeel free to dm if you need some advice.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe just returned home (in Germany) from our crazy one-month trip in Asia. The Reddit community gave us very valuable tips before going, so we wanted to share some of our life hacks and things to keep in mind for traveling on a budget.\n\nBy traveling on a budget, I don't mean staying in shared rooms in cheap hostels, eating from convenience stores, or taking inconvenient (but cheap) transportation. Hopefully, this post will be very helpful to some of you who are going to one of the above countries soon.\n\n**Quick summary:**\n\n* 29 days in total. Departed on the 18th of February and returned on the 19th of March back home\n* 5 nights in Shanghai\n* 6 nights in Hong Kong\n* 2 nights in Beijing\n* 2 nights in Seoul\n* 12 nights in Japan\n\n**ACCOMMODATION:**\n\nFor a total of 27 nights, we stayed only 6 nights in hotels. 6 nights cost us ca. 180 Euros. For China, we used\u00a0Trip website\u00a0(3 nights, 3 cities, 3 hotels). I would highly encourage you to either avoid using\u00a0Trip whatsoever or to be very careful with the hotel chosen. Almost all of their reviews and pictures are fake.\n\nFor the other 21 nights, we got very lucky by organizing 3 (almost) consecutive exchanges using home exchanges in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Kyoto. I would highly encourage many of you to try the platform. We've been using it for almost 7 years and have stayed in so many different places. Even if we had booked the cheapest options in these three cities, it would have cost us a minimum of \u20ac 1.1K\n\n**TRANSPORT:**\n\n***Flights:***\n\n* There are direct flights from Germany (Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich) to China (our first point of arrival). These however cost at least \u20ac 500-600. Instead, we found direct flights for \u20ac 200 from Budapest, Hungary. We did have to take an additional flight to/from Budapest. Ongoing, we decided to arrive in Budapest 2 days before so we can also explore the city. For the return flight, we had to wait ca. 6 hours at the Budapest Airport, but in the end, it all worked out. This slight \"inconvenience\" resulted in savings of \u20ac 1.5K (including the additional costs to arrive in Budapest). We booked with\u00a0AirChina and I must admit both flights were very comfortable, with 2 meals per flight provided, and extra amenities.\n* Booking 2-3 months in advance is the ideal timeframe.\n* Also, oftentimes connecting flights are way cheaper than a direct flight. So you might wanna explore such options as well.\n* My first point of reference is ALWAYS skyscanner.com! Instead of checking for a specific city, I do research for the entire country. Once I find the best option, I go and book everything through the original website of the airline company. I NEVER book through intermediaries.\n* Once in Asia, we had 4 additional flights that we booked with SpringAirlines, AirChina, and JejuAir. Overall all ok, you get what you paid for. One very interesting thing about flights in Asia, oftentimes, is that the closer you are to the departure date, the cheaper the price! For example, we booked 3 months in advance Shanghai - Hong Kong with Spring Airlines. Paid ca. \u20ac 180 for both of us. 3 weeks before departing, I checked again, it would've cost us \u20ac 120.\n\n***TRAINS:***\n\n* We used trains only in Japan, more precisely the SHINKANSEN. So many times actually :)\n* Our trip to Japan was in west Japan (the area between Kyoto and Hiroshima). So we made use of the JR West Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass. We paid \u20ac 105 for a 5-day pass between Hiroshima and Kyoto. The Shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima is included in this price. Boy oh boy, we saved so much with this pass. We did: Day 1: Kyoto-Hiroshima, Day 2: Kyoto - Himeji - Kobe, Day 3: Kyoto - Kurashiki - Okayama, Day 4: Kyoto - Takamatsu (Shikoku Island), Day 5: Kyoto - Osaka. If booked individually, it would've cost us at least \u20ac 340 (I stopped calculating at one point). Main takeaway: Make use of the regional JR Passes, instead of the JR pass (it is not worth it at all!).\n\n***METRO:***\n\n* We used almost the whole time the metro. Metro in China is super cheap! Make use of it.\n\n**FOOD & SOUVENIRS:**\n\n* Food in China, was on average, the cheapest. There were days, where we spent ca.\u20ac 30 per day, 3 meals a day, transport including for the both of us. Install AliPay (you will definitely gonna need it). Almost every time, in every restaurant, if you book via AliPay, you will pay less (you get various discounts) compared to paying at the restaurant. The savings are sometimes even 50%! If you download the mini-app Meituan (within AliPay), you can get so many different discounts for food. Unfortunately, our Chinese is pretty bad, so we didn't use it.\n* For Seoul and for Japan, our budget was, on average, \u20ac 40 for both of us. Of course, the main thing we always do (a strict rule we have) is to avoid the touristy area. So we do a quick research on Google as to where to eat.\n* In general, for every country, AVOID restaurants where there is someone outside with a sign targeting customers. A good restaurant doesn't need that.\n\nTraveling doesn't have to be expensive. One just needs the time and dedication to explore the most cost-effective options when traveling. This is our 3rd year in a row visiting Asian countries, and we always organize longer journeys that include several countries. Visiting Japan from China would cost us an additional \u20ac 160 as opposed to taking a flight from Europe.\n\nAs a reference, last year we did a 1-month trip in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand which cost us ca. 3K.\n\nFeel free to dm if you need some advice.",

Visiting Japan from China would cost us an additional \u20ac 160 as opposed to taking a flight from Europe.\n\nAs a reference, last year we did a 1-month trip in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand which cost us ca. 3K.\n\nFeel free to dm if you need some advice.",

        "selftext": "I have always wanted to visit New York City ever since I was a kid. I always thought of it as a city of charming high-rises, busy streets and subways, and most importantly the largest financial center ever existed on Earth. As a Finance major, I want to understand the key elements of the economic success of NYC. What has driven the robust financial sector in NYC that allows it to surpass London (another city that is on my bucket list)? I came to see it for myself and as I always say to my friends, the rest is history. It was an epic and otherworldly experience of a lifetime. I know for a fact that NYC is a city with a lot of issues (homelessness, drugs, poor hygiene in certain areas\u2026etc). I got it. But we cannot deny that NYC is a charming, glamorous city in and out of itself. I love the blend of modern skyscrapers with antiquated 2 to 3-story buildings cladded by the brown-ish bricks. These old buildings probably were erected decades if not a century ago, witnessing the development of NYC and its transition towards the position it is sitting at right now. Liberty Island- where the statue of liberty is located, was also part of my adventure. The city is also home to a lot of expats and people of different nationalities. I don\u2019t know for sure but what I can definitely tell is diversity is also what makes NYC stand out amongst its peers in the US. You can get really good burritos or BBQ in Texas but you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to try let\u2019s say, Turkish kebabs or some Eastern European foods. On top of all these things, NYC public transportation is not as appalling as portrayed by the mainstream media. Yes, it is dirty, it is run-down, and it desperately needs the maintenance to be carried out by the MTA. But at the very least, it still covers pretty much the entirety of NYC, allowing you to travel to wherever you want at a fraction of the cost of an Uber ride. As each ride only sets you back $2.90 and you can transfer through stations at no additional cost, it is really budget-friendly for those with a limited amount of money like me. What about navigation? Well, I only have one word to say: \u201cI counted on Google Maps for directions and indeed it was phenomenal. As a Google Map enthusiast, I used to spend hours looking at the satellite image of the cities and as a result, I have gotten the grip of it. It may seem that I was going off on a tangent here but this habit of binging Google Maps really rendered me the prior familiarization with the city I am going to visit. This helps me navigate better within the city which ultimately saves me a lot of time and money. I had already known where to go and what to do before I arrived at the airport. Just to give an exemplary case, I literally saved 50 bucks by virtue of taking two buses while an Uber ride to Laguardia Terminal C would easily cost me 60 bucks. I got to the airport on time for just $5.80. Could you believe that would be possible in NYC? The answer is yes but you need to do your own research and more importantly, be willing to muster up the energy to walk long distances. That way, you can explore every corner, every small alley and see how the locals actually live outside of tourist hotspots. Because you know what, what makes traveling so great is not just about the overhyped or oversaturated areas, it is more about the authentic life of people here and there. It is about enriching your own knowledge and understanding of the world through the lenses of a local. It is about broadening your mind and bringing you new opportunities for growth. \n  I know I have rambled a lot but now it is time for the specific locations that I visited. First of all, I really love the one-world observatory which provides visitors with a panoramic view of the entire city. I could see the Brooklyn Bridge dating back to the late 1800s or all these historical landmarks in Midtown Manhattan like the Empire State Building. The building itself is the tallest skyscraper in the Western hemisphere to have ever existed. Also, I got to try some Chinese foods, specifically Shanghai ones in ChinaTown which were so tangy and flavorful. The dimsum and the pickle noodles were so scrumptious. From the perspective of a backpacker, this was an epic journey, a testament to the knowledge and travel experiences I have accrued for years of binging flight and hotel reviewers. Without the guidance and observation of my parents, I still managed to take care of myself and more importantly, navigate through a sophisticated city such as New York. I was having a whale of a time there and it seems like I couldn\u2019t drag away from such an epic experience. I have a message for New Yorkers out there:\u2019Don\u2019t take things for granted\u2019 and start appreciating what you guys enjoy\u201d. So that just wrapped up my Spring Break trip. I could literally just wimp out and spend the entirety of my breaks on campus doing nothing but I am glad I have attempted and indeed went beyond my comfort zone. It was worth every cent that I spent and I look forward to visiting other US cities in the future. Life is not just all about money, it is about the experiences!!!\n",

My planned visit is for 10 days only.\nMy question is ,can the aunt complain to border or any other government agencies which can cause to deny me entry at the border? \nI did mention my aunt as relative on DS-160 form as it's a requirement to disclose blood relations.\nI have got nothing to hide neither I am afraid as I can answer any questions cbp asks me at the border and I can prove strong ties to my country.\nAny inputs will be appreciated.\nThanks you!",

        "selftext": "I thought i'd just write about my experience of booking via travelup and shenzhen airlines.\n\nHelping out my parents plan their trip to China, I used skyscanner and found a deal significantly cheaper \\~\u00a3300-400 less than the next cheapest. The overall process of booking was straightfoward and confirmation of flights came through email immediately after purchase.\n\nComing up to the date of the flights, 24 hours before, received an email for online check-in. This is where I hope to give some insight. For those booking with a third party travel agent with Shenzhen airlines, the online checkin is going to make you go through a panic attack. None of the flight confirmation details were recognised. The advice is to go to the airport on the day and check-in manually at the kiosk. The process of checking in at Heathrow Terminal 2 was quite smooth, kiosk opened 4 hours before flight departure. I would recommend arriving early, as soon as kiosk were opened there was already a long line of people.\n\nSomething that made me worry before the fight was a small print from the travel agent was this \"To reconfirm your TravelUp flight to Shenzhen, you must\u00a0contact the airline directly, up to 72 hours before departure, to ensure all details are accurate and there are no unexpected issues with your booking\". I realised this small print way too late, but was fortuante that there were no changes to the flights. \n\nMy parents have yet to come back from China, will update this post if any issues come on their return flight.\n\nMoral of the story - save \u00a3300-400 but paid for in mental stress.

        "selftext": "Due to personal circumstances, I will be taking an unexpected trip to Taiwan this upcoming week. I'm hyped about it, but **I don't have the time I usually do to calculate every last detail**, so I was hoping to make this a more chill experience by basing myself in Taipei (except for one day in Kaohsiung) and taking bunch of mostly-easy day trips... but here is the itinerary, please rip into it and **feel free to critique anything that doesn't fit.** \n\n**DAY 1**  \nArrive in Taipei in the early afternoon. Immigration, getting to the hostel, and maybe hang out in a creative park/a literal park. \n\nIf tired, just be at the hostel and get some work done. \n\n**DAY 2**   \nVisit a temple in the morning (Lungshan Temple?)  \nVisit a museum - current main candidates are the Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines or the National Museum. I am aware they are very different in scale, but I quite enjoy smaller museums!\n\n**DAY 3**   \nTrip to Yilan, visit the National Center for Traditional Arts  \nOR   \nTrip to Wulai, explore around --> leaning towards this at the moment\n\n**DAY 4**  \nHead to Kaohsiung in the morning. The schedule here will be very free, but the one thing I definitely want to see is Fo Guang Shan Temple. Mostly, though, I'm meeting a local friend in Kaohsiung, so I'll let them take the lead. Sleep here.   \n  \n**DAY 5**  \nIf anything is still left over to do in Kaohsiung, do it. Otherwise, take the train to Taipei again.  Considering whether the slow train is worth the savings. Not much planned here; I was hoping to stop by in Taichung and take a short walk around the Rainbow Village, because I love colorful places and less museum-y art, but I'm worried it would be too long. \n\n**DAY 6**   \nConsidering whether to do Jiufen and Shifen, even if it's a weekend. On one hand, they look cool and my friend recommended them to me. On the other, they also look very touristy, and will probably be very busy. \n\n**DAY 7**   \nNo solid plans. I will either improvise or ask for advice from people who've been around. I am also considering leaving this as my \"buffer\" day.   \n  \n**Possible variations**: I have considered arriving in Taipei and immediately taking the train to Kaohsiung, but this would depend on my friend's availability, and I'm a little worried that it would be too tiring after waking up in the morning to take a bus to the airport, a flight, and then more trains. \n\nSo please, critique my itinerary! Is there something I should skip? Something I should add? Something else I should consider? I'd say that crowds are a bit harsh for me, but they're slightly more manageable in open environments. My main interest is travelling around and hopefully see nice things and eat good food without too much stress. \n\nPretty much the only thing I am 100% sure of is Kaohsiung, so everything else can be changed. I enjoy temples, parks, and open-air museums a lot; I usually love museums in general, but I think I'm a bit hungover with four-hour-long history museums for now, unless they really are spectacular. I am not the strongest person around, but if there's any fun hiking that won't be unbelievably crowded, I'll definitely consider it. However, I'm travelling solo, so I'm a little worried about wild trails. ",

        "selftext": "Fresh off the California Zephyr, Chicago to San Francisco in 62 hours, and settling into my hostel after a delectable (and much needed after the gas station burrito level quality foodstuffs offered on the Amtrak) Georgian meal of traditional lamb stew with tarragon and green plum paired with a chilled glass of amber wine (skin contact, as in aged in clay pots, as it has been done since 300BC, with the skin still attached to the grape,making a wine that is altogether amber and altogether not red or white); I meet Hakeem. \n\nI tell him that I don\u2019t know if Im wired and need to stay up another day to spin off all this energy I\u2019ve suddenly got after being freed up to stand free and walk around or if my body needs to pass out after such a lengthy journey and all the extremes it entails; and he responds with \u201cwell, if you want to take it all night i have a spare ticket to the mayors\u2019 inauguration party!\u201d\n\nAnd, with my tradition of making bad and sudden choices on first days of trips, so as to get bad choices wrung out of my system quick in order to make way for good ones (like not blowing tons of dough on high level sushi in back alley Tokyo fish markets); i reply with a \u201chell yeah, lets do it!\u201d And im following him through Chinatown telling this man I\u2019ve just met what my name is and why im here and im asking him who he is. \n\nHe\u2019s from LA and got laid off from his interior design job and now hes living at the hostel; renting a bed in an 8 bed dorm.  \n\nThe hostel is wonderfully low rent, the exact kind of homeless chic place i was looking for.  It\u2019s the girl at the front desks\u2019 first day on the job.  The door code to the front door doesn\u2019t work.  \u201cYeah,\u201d says the manager, \u201cthe door is being a little moody today;\u201d which is an altogether \u2018im not going to deal with it\u2019 passing of the buck kind of response one would expect from the numb and distanced millennial that is filling this joint to the seams.  \u201cI work here, this thing should be my problem, but I\u2019ve decided to make it your problem,\u201d was the end result.  The door code doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019ve got to hope someone is here to let you in cuz i have no idea how to fix it and my shift is over in an hour and I\u2019ve got to go get drunk and cancel people on social media.   She didn\u2019t even show me where my room was or how to find the bathroom.  \u201cThe rooms are back there,\u201d she says as she waves her hands around her head in a circle while staring down at her phone, \u201cand there\u2019s some bathrooms down here if the ones upstairs are full,\u201d followed by a second hand wave that was obviously developed and perfected as a child at annual princess parties paid for by her millionaire father before she decided fuck it, hes not gonna buy me that pony, and decided to take the requisite gap year as all trust fund babies do \u2018slumming it\u2019 at a San Francisco hostel.  God, I love it. \n\nHakeem was the right choice, over the anti socials and the tech nomads and the first time backpackers and the lifetime backpackers; all treading water and in a kind of stasis of never wanting to make choices or to settle down or to choose a direction, all in the hostel and waiting, waiting, for something to happen that they can latch onto instead of making something happen, all not talking and staring at their phones and waiting for that first beer to crack open so they can finally feed into that nascent alcoholism all young pre professionals are developing far better, far purer, than they are social skills; so i chose Hakeem. \n\n\u201cHow is it that i show up to this hostel and right away a guy offers me a ticket to a mayoral inauguration?\u201d  I ask him.\n\n\u201cWell, my friends are all moody and i called a bunch of them to go with me but they all said no and so here you are,\u201d was the answer.  He wasn\u2019t getting the philisophical bent to my query but it\u2019s all good, sufficient response.  \n\nHe got laid off, got rid of his $3k a month apartment, was now homeless and living in the hostel and running a start up postcard business. He took all his severance pay, five figures of severance pay, and designed and printed and packaged 200,000 San Francisco themed post card sets that he\u2019s sure are going to sell.  No one has bought them bulk yet but someone will, he talked to Amoeba music and they seemed interested, \u201csomeone needs to buy like 10k of these cuz im selling them on the street for $2 a pack, man, and it is not exactly making me the money i expected\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cOh really?!\u201d I exclaim, \u201cim a traveling artist, i work the fair and festival circuit.  I feel like there\u2019s some overlap here.\u201d  And i start to ask him questions about overhead and what the market is like and that a friend of mine is asking me to produce stickers for his roving festival booth; trying here to get some real information and trying to offer up information in return and Hakeem says.  \u201cI don\u2019t know man, I just started this two weeks ago.\u201d He\u2019s entirely uninterested in giving me the info i want, and also entirely unimpressed that im doing what he does but somewhat succeeding at it; as in later on in this very evening he\u2019ll be complaining about the people who make the kind of money i do while also wanting to be making that money himself.  It\u2019s all good, i really like the guy.  This disinterest and this spur of the moment; its all coming out of a positivity.  He\u2019s having fun and exploring and in a good moood and doesn\u2019t want to get into the bullshit details and i can respect that.  \n\nWe reach Chinatown and it is PACKED. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d He exclaims.  We\u2019ve got a ticket to an event, an indoor event, but it is at the center of the outdoor event.  Some very very very famous DJ is doing an outdoor set as part of the inauguration celebration and he is EXACTLY the kind of dude that all these SF techies, these millennial kids with disposable income, are wiling to get trampled in a crowd for.  \n\nThis is exactly the kind of place id never be, the kind of place i would never freely choose to enter because danger danger danger is in crowds crowds crowds, but now im following Hakeem and his green super Mario kart beanie and using it as a beacon, while he pushes his way through a sardine packed crowd wall to wall in Chinatown that is of the kind i can just NOT properly explain.  This was packed, serious packed.  We were squeezing our way through one of those 1000 piece wheels of Chinese firecrackers.  Packed tight, right up against the other, wrapped in wax paper, rigid, unmoving; but Hakeem is determined to get to this party and he is pushing his way through the crowd and i am staying on him.  Gosh i hope that pack of Chinese firecrackers don\u2019t get neared to a spark. \n\nSurprisingly, we are almost to the stage.  We are dead center.  Every direction i look in; people.  Firecracker roll of people.  No way out through these people.  He sees some people he knows, a Brazilian guy.  They\u2019re holding up their cel phone, \u201chey Hakeem, say hi to Brazil!!\u201d  \u201cHi Brazil!!\u201d  \u201cThanks man, im filming content for my YouTube channel.\u201d  Ambitious youth suddenly climbs a streetlight, the tens of thousands all reach for their cel phones to get their video of the moment, the boy is a hero; the boy for one fleeting moment has the attention of everyone.  The DJ stops his set DEAD.  \u201cIm not playing one second more until you get down!!\u201d  He shouts.  \n\nThe DJ is dressed like a low rent Asian Neo from the matrix.  a 3rd tier imitation Asian imitating a guy who was a white WASP imitating the best of asian cinema.  He can\u2019t sing, hes out of tune with his track.  Rory, who\u2019s hiding in a restaurant alcove with me, whom i bought a beer and told him to remember that beer i bought him when the stampede starts, to save my life, to remember the beer, tells me \u201cthis is his hit song, this is what everyone is here for!!\u201d\u2019 \n\nIt\u2019s not impressive. \n\nHakeem grabs me by the shoulder.  \n\n\u201cLook at this, this is the San Francisco tech scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. I think hes meaning techno, as in these are the electronic music makers and fans.\n\n\u201cNo, this is the fucking tech scene.  These are all the young people making $150k a year to work on their laptops from home.  This is what they want, they just want to think they\u2019re cool and drink shitty beer and see a DJ and they think they are the best, that this is the best it can ever be\u201d.\n\nSuddenly the crowd starts pushing. Violently.  Not the whole crowd, just our corner.  People are shouting, \u201cstop pushing, people are going to get hurt!\u201d  A friend group that should have never come to this thing, who especially shouldn\u2019t have made their way to the center want OUT NOW and they are showing no respect and they are pushing their way to get out.  \n\n\u201cJust get out of the way, get out of the fucking way!\u201d  Some moron Jersey kid is shouting as he pushes an old Asian lady out of his way.  The rest of us, quite soberly and kindly, are shouting back \u201cslow down, calm down, stop pushing, we\u2019ll get you out.\u201d And they are having none of it.  Some 4 foot tall and 5 foot wide bald Greek guy in a paisley shirt and sunglasses that look like they cost about $1500 shouts \u201cfuck it!\u201d And heaves forward.  I yell \u201cstop this, people are going to get trampled!\u201d His friend, a girl who looks to be no more than 21, and who is clutching to him like a baby koala to its mothers belly, gets in my face and yells \u201cdidn\u2019t you take fucking physics class in high school you idiot?\u201d And im utterly shocked and say, \u201cwhat?!?!\u201d In response and she says it again; \u201cdidn\u2019t you take physics in high school you idiot\u201d and i am just too shocked, too blown over both by the self entitlement that these people are very very willing to hurt a lot of people just so they can get out (and wont get out if they cause a stampede, they\u2019ll die) and by the utter refutation of physics that she is expressing because all i can think about is thermo dynamics and critical mass and chain reaction and that if you push against a brick wall its not going to suddenly let you through- the physics is that if they push against a crowd and everyone falls over, people are going to get hurt.  But i guess this is the state of education in the \u2018ol USA cuz she\u2019s pretty confident in her physics knowledge and she\u2019s ready to kill us all just to get out.\n\nI understand why part of the country hates the other part.  I understand this anger.  \n\nI look at this angry group willing to kill everyone else, willing to push the people to the ground to get out.  They\u2019ve taken too much, that\u2019s what it is.  The crowd anxiety has set in.  Their eyes are coal black, dialated.  They\u2019re on something and what ever they are on, it\u2019s not mixing well with the scene. It\u2019s a Wednesday at 7pm, a work night.  It\u2019s a working class neighborhood.  It\u2019s Chinese restaurants, old ladies and old men standing in the doorways of their restaurants and scratching their heads at the scene and their regulars sitting inside and eating their congee and ignoring the throng outside, and these kids took too much because they are privileged as shit to party every night and treat every street like it is theirs and every crowd like it is in their way and they went to a bad place and they are in a big crowd and thank god enough of us were sane and we handled it well and we got those kids out of there before they caused a stampede.  They weren\u2019t nice, they didn\u2019t say thank you, they yelled at us and cursed at us and were full of poison and hate as we worked our asses off to save everyone\u2019s lives and stop a stampede and stop a trample and clear a path for them to get out.  They left, they didn\u2019t say thank you, i never encounter this kind of toxicity anywhere in the world except the USA; i understand why people hate us. \n\nA mom, a fucking mom, was trying to push through the crowd with her little baby in her arms!  What could have happpened to that baby had the crowd toppled?  But also, why the fuck did she push herself to the center of that crowd?!?!?  Why did a lady with a newborn see a packed crowd of thousands, no room to walk, and think \u201ci will walk me and my defenseless baby to the center of it!\u201d  Idiot, no sense of self preservation. \n\nI understand in that moment why half the country hates this half.  None of this is good.  It\u2019s bad, it\u2019s harmful.  But they\u2019re only harming themselves.  Really; we should let them do it, it\u2019s not hurting anyone.  It\u2019s dumb and its not that fun and its sad that they think this is fun but its even sadder that the rednecks and the white trash and the republicans resent these folks and are threatened by them.  Myself; I don\u2019t get it.  They are harmless, as long as you don\u2019t set them off. \n\n\u201cI got fired from my job cuz im a republican\u201d Hakeem tells me as an utterly methed out and rail thin cross dresser dances on the stairs leading into the basement restaurant we\u2019re having a quick beer in.  \u201cIt was all women working this job who hated trump and they didn\u2019t like me after I mentioned my politics. Before that, they all wanted to fuck me, but now they hate me.\u201d  He\u2019s black, dreadlocks down to his ass, as tall as my 6\u20193\u201d and with a youthful and handsome face; absolutely they wanted to fuck him. He has a super Mario beanie, hes starting a postcard business, he wants to travel the world.  I told him what i do, that i have an arts business and i travel the world, but he didn\u2019t wanna talk about that; he\u2019s still trying to get into the party.  \n\n\u201cThey just started letting anyone in, they aren\u2019t checking tickets anymore\u201d says a guy pushing past us in the crowd.  Fuck it.  There\u2019s no way we\u2019re\u2019 getting through this.  It\u2019s been an hour and a half and we haven\u2019t moved an inch past our spot by the restaurant.  This was amazing, im glad i came, im glad i saw this crowd, im glad i got to see how fucked up things can be; i gotta get out. \n\nI tell Hakeem and Rory, whom i bought the beer, \u201cthis is too much, I gotta get out\u201d and i push my way out, calmly and with friendly eyes and causing no problems, and i walk the streets and i listen to these young tech millennials walking these storied streets of the beat movement and the hippie movement and i see the writers and the jazz musicians and the cultural innovators in the grit and in the shadows and in the dust, their remnants kicked up in the winds making their way up here from the raging fires of Los Angeles, and in my walk i hear well over 15 separate groups of said young tech millennials saying to each other, \u201clets go to Vesuvius,\u201d in reference to some popular bar or nightclub, each one of them repeating the same script in the same tone of voice and each of them boasting that they\u2019d discovered this place and that it was their little secret and they are going to be a hero to their friends for showing it to them and i eventually walk by the place in my stroll and, surprise surprise, it\u2019s got a line out the door and im hearing the millennials bemoan \u201coh shit, we can\u2019t get into Vesuvius tonight\u201d.  \n\nI decide to hurry to my hostel, it is 10pm and im not sure if anyone will be working the front desk.  The door code issue was never fixed, i may not be able to get in.  \n\nI got in.  ",

        "selftext": "I often travel in and across India. and for me, travel, in many ways, has been a process of exploration and discovery - not just of new places, but also of new aspects of oneself. Budget travel, in particular, can be a wonderful opportunity for growth and learning. Whenever I travelled on a budget, I was often compelled to step out of my comfort zone. I had to navigate unfamiliar public transportation systems, stay in modest accommodations, or communicate with locals who may not speak my language. These experiences were challenging, but at the same time,  incredibly enriching. I learnt resilience, adaptability, and resourcefulness. Budget travel also encouraged me to engage more deeply with the local culture. Instead of staying in a luxury hotel and dining in expensive restaurants, I was eating street food, shopping in local markets, or staying in a homestay with a local family. These experiences gave me a more authentic and immersive understanding of the place I was visiting.  At the same time I tried to minimize my environmental impact (for example, I carried my own food container rather than asking for plastic), respect local customs and traditions, and contribute positively to the local economy. So, embrace the adventure of budget travel. It may not always be comfortable, but it will certainly be memorable.  I remembered a quote from Sadhguru, \"Travel is not just about exploring new geographies, but about shedding old ideas and prejudices. It is about seeing the same world with new eyes.\"",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently in the process of starting my own group tour company. These tours will originally begin in Thailand before spreading into other South-East Asian countries and hopefully even further afield. The company will focus on small groups (Max 8), local guides, and 24-7 support before, during, and after the tour. \n\nI do have a few questions for those who have taken and enjoyed tours like this that I would love some help on if people wouldn't mind answering one or some of them.\n\n1. How much is too much? How filled do you like your days to be and do you expect your every move to be planned for you or do you enjoy a mix of both group activities and solo exploring?\n2. In regards to meals. Breakfast will always be included at the hotel. For lunches and dinners, is it better to leave some evenings free, especially during an afternoon with nothing planned? Also, what is usually the style of lunches, and dinners on these tours? As I aim for it to feel like a small group of friends traveling, is it better that people go to the restaurant and order the meal they want or is it always buffet style?\n3. When moving between cities and places, do you like to have something in the middle to break up the journey? It can take some time to get from one place to another in countries like Thailand so would a 4 hour journey be too much or is that length of journey fine once a toilet stop is included?\n4. Would group drinks be a good idea to have on certain nights? I am not talking about a crazy party but for example, a sky bar in Bangkok where I would include a certain number of cocktails for each guest. Is this something people would enjoy after dinner, or do people prefer to split into their own groups?\n5. On past tours you have taken what would you consider to be the main pro from the company you booked from and if you have any some things you wished they had done differently?\n\nThank you so much to anyone who has taken the time to read this and can help in any way. It is much appreciated. \n\nRegards\n\nAdam\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "The Roman Empire did not fall in 476 CE.  There was no such thing as the Byzantine Empire.  Rome was not destroyed by the Barbarians.  There are several misconceptions surrounding the Fall of Rome.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtydilisqkxb1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd616304ac67c53ea6453eb1f14ab29ef063ec13\n\n**Plagues Decimated Rome**\n\nImagine a continual pandemic from 249 to 262 CE! Just like the Black Plague, the Plague of Cyprian probably wiped out 1/3 to 1/2 of the Roman population. \n\n**The Roman Empire Did NOT Fall in 476 CE**\n\nIn 324 CE Constantine had reunified the Tetrarchy that had divided the Roman Empire into four regions.  In the year 330 CE, the Emperor Constantine decided to move the seat of the government from Rome to Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople. \n\nIn other words, prosperous Constantinople (now Istanbul), which was the financial and educational centre of the Roman Empire, became the political centre.  Important things to know are that:\n\n1. people of that time still called it the Roman Empire;\n\n2. the principle language of this empire was Greek not Latin;\n\n3. the term Byzantine Empire was only coined in the 16th century by a German historian \u2013 it never existed!\n\n**Rome the City Fell in 476 CE**\n\nRome the city fell in 476 CE because it could no longer pay its mercenaries. Odoacer, head of the Germanic mercenaries protecting Rome, took over the administration of Rome, nominally on behalf of the Roman Empire. The city continued to function.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see\u2026\n\n[**Unravelling Misconceptions -- the Real Story behind the Fall of Ancient Rome**](https://terraencounters.wordpress.com/2023/10/31/unraveling-misconceptions-the-real-story-behind-the-fall-of-ancient-rome/)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm reaching out because I'm stuck in a tricky travel situation and really need some advice. Hopefully, someone here has dealt with something similar or can point me in the right direction.\n\nI've planned a special 10-day trip to Bali this October. Not only is this a chance for some much-needed relaxation and adventure, but it's also to celebrate a close friend's 21st birthday. Now, here's where things got complicated: I wasn't aware that to enter Bali, a passport needs at least 6 months of validity. By the time I realized this, even if I had applied for a new passport right when we made our booking, I'd still have been a month short for this requirement.\n\nTo tackle this, I quickly got an Emergency Passport. It was a tight squeeze, and I wasn't even sure it would get to me before my flight. I was overjoyed when it arrived, but then I hit another roadblock: Bali might not accept this for the usual visa procedures.\n\nI initially thought I could go for a Visa or Visa on Arrival, but with the emergency passport, that might not be possible. Does anyone have insights on other ways to get a visa for Indonesia in this scenario? Or perhaps there's a different workaround someone knows of, like a declaration based on family emergency? Given the emotional and financial investments in this trip, I'm all ears for any viable solutions. And if someone provides a solution that works, there's a substantial generous reward ($$$$) as a token of my gratitude!\n\nNavigating these waters has me pretty overwhelmed, so any advice or direction from this community would be a lifesaver. I deeply appreciate any time and assistance you can provide.\n\nThank you, everyone, and wishing you all smooth travels!",

I visited Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, and absolutely fell in love with the country. Ate so much food good and met some amazing people. Just wanted to thank this community for the culmination of advice and experiences that is so readily available, and perhaps act as support/encouragement for any people my age that are on the fence about taking a solo trip. Go for it!",

I made some great friends there, traveled together with some of them for weeks, experimented with different drugs and found people who are ok with my lack of experience and willing to keep an eye on me.

I also feel like SEA cannot be determined by few highlights, as most of it is just the feeling of the place, staying there longer, embracing the culture, gradually adapting, embracing different clothing, the slow vibe, and slow traveling to appreciate every small place before moving to the next.\n\nAnd to the people on the fence, I've been like you, I've been lurking in this sub for one year before I had the guts to do it.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \n  \nI\u2019m heading to Japan solo for the first time, and I haven\u2019t planned anything yet besides my flights. What\u2019s kinda stressing me out is that I\u2019ll be there during peak season (and Golden Week!) with no real plans\u2014plus, my birthday happens while I\u2019m there. I\u2019m a bit worried I\u2019ll feel lonely and end up having a kinda sad birthday.\n\nNormally, I\u2019d book a nice hotel for the occasion, but Tokyo\u2019s prices are insane right now. And honestly, if my only option is a tiny, soulless room in the middle of nowhere, I\u2019d rather go for a fun hostel with good vibes.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a man in my 30s and into bars (craft beer is a big plus), music, and food. Not a huge fan of nightclubs, but I love places where I can meet people, have good conversations, and share some laughs over drinks.\n\nSo, what would you recommend for a solo birthday in Tokyo? Any must-visit spots, fun bars, or unique things to do?\n\nI\u2019ll likely be in Tokyo since my birthday is on May 4th and my flight home is on the morning of May 7th, so I don\u2019t have much time for long trips.\n\n# My initial ideas:\n\n**Plan A:** Book a hostel near Lake Kawaguchi for some Mt. Fuji views. But from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s a pretty quiet, early-to-bed kinda vibe\u2014no bars, no nightlife. Sounds relaxing, but I definitely need some social energy (I\u2019m a night owl).\n\n**Plan B:** Book a love hotel for myself (if that\u2019s even possible solo?). Could be a fun, weird experience\u2014even better with company, but hey, I\u2019m realistic.\n\n**Plan C:** Stay in a fancy but fun and social hostel in Tokyo, explore the city, and see where the night takes me. Hopefully, I\u2019ll meet some people so it doesn\u2019t turn into a lonely night\u2014I just have no idea how the nightlife works in Japan for solo travelers.\n\nI also thought about checking out a maid caf\u00e9, but honestly, going alone feels kinda awkward.\n\nAny recommendations would be super appreciated! Cheers!\n\n**P.S.** I have a lot of tattoos, so most onsens are probably off-limits\u2014though since this will be at the end of my Japan trip, I\u2019ll likely have already tried one somewhere if possible.",

I am a big fan of history and art, also love snorkelling so desperately looking for places to go where I can go right off the beach rather than having to book boat trips. The Perehtian Islands look great for it but I am unsure if the journey is worth it, its a bit of a detour and a lot of articles say that Kota Bharu isn\u2019t very nice. Something else to note is I am from London so being in big busy cities doesn\u2019t bother me. Also curious if adding Bali or Laos or the Philippines is worth exploring or if there\u2019s any other must visit places I\u2019ve missed. \n\nWould appreciate recommendations of activities to do and places to visit, how long to stay in each area.",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\nThis upcoming June I am taking an extended solo trip beginning in Asia (Tokyo). I am planning to be gone for at least six months, with the idea being that after that amount of time I will reassess how I am feeling/my current budget etc. even though I anticipate that I will decide to continue my trip (over the last couple years I discovered how much I love solo travel and I have been planning this trip for the better part of two years). \n\nTo keep this post as short as possible, my current plan is to land in Tokyo and travel throughout Japan for a few weeks before continuing to a few countries in East Asia, the Philippines, AUS/NZ, and then going back up into Southeast Asia through AUS, and I'm planning this to take the aforementioned six months before continuing on to most likely Eastern Europe through the Caucasus region. \n\nMy dilemma is that I have been becoming more and more interested in visiting Mongolia and Central Asia (KAZ, KYR, UZB, TAJ) after these six months. I am a moderately outdoorsy person, on my previous trips to Europe I've always tried to book tours for more countryside regions of whichever country I've been in, but I haven't done any rugged camping trips admittedly, and I know these regions are more like that instead of a more metropolitan style. But that's not my issue. According to my timeline I would be planning on visiting these countries around December/January, when it would be extremely cold and doing things in these countries might be more difficult. \n\nI'm not extremely committed to visiting these countries but I would love to see the beauty they offer. I would probably spend around 2 weeks in Mongolia and maybe around a month for the four countries in Central Asia. Should I try to visit these countries on the beginning leg of my trip, like after Japan in June/July while its still warm? I am also open to swinging back to Asia around next Spring when it gets warmer and I would imagine a lot more beautiful as well, but I would like some advice for places to go after (most likely) Vietnam in the winter months if I were to keep my current itinerary. It is possible that I spend more time in the countries for my current itinerary as planned, so I may still be in Asia by the time next Spring comes around. \n\nWould also appreciate any experiences travelling in Central Asia/Mongolia and where I could find some resources for finding tours/places to stay/etc., thanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI was originally going to go to Uzbekistan this spring break but felt that a trip to Taiwan would feel a bit more 'spring time.' I want to try and spend some more time on quality rather than quantity, focusing mostly on Taipei and Alishan, so I came up with the following itinerary.\n\nMonday, 4/14 - TAIPEI \n\nArrive early in the morning, check in to hotel, rest, and then explore Ximending and the surrounding area. Nothing major, just going with the flow and trying to enjoy the good food and relax after the flight.\n\nTuesday, 4/15 - TAIPEI\n\nTry to hit the main attractions - Elephant Mountain hike in the morning, check out Chiang Kai-Shek memorial, Taipei 101, and maybe ending the night at a night market for dinner\n\nWednesday, 4/16 - --> CHIAYI to FENQIHU\n\nTake an early morning train to Chiayi and from there to Fenqihu. Enjoy the forest vibes.\n\nThursday, 4/17 -> ALISHAN\n\nGo up to Alishan and walk some trails.\n\nFriday, 4/18 - ALISHAN -> TAIPEI\n\nWake up for an early sunrise, walk around, and then head back to Taipei for the evening.\n\nSaturday, 4/19 - TAIPEI/JIUFEN\n\nChill in Taipei and head out to Jiufen for the evening, coming back at night.\n\nSunday, 4/20 - TAIPEI\n\nLast night in Taipei\n\nMonday, 4/21 - Leave\n\nHave a breakfast and then head back to the airport\n\n  \nWhat do you all think? I am only going to be in the country for a week, so I'm trying not to pack too much. At the same time, I am not exactly the type of person who feels the need to see every facet of a site or town. My biggest question is regarding that Wednesday - a whole day in Chiayi/Fenqihu may seem to be too much according to some, yet others say that it is worth it. I really want to see the bamboo forest and misty trails.",

Is it possible to have something local and not too touristy? Do you think two weeks is enough?  I would also like some information on Nepal, what do you recommend I see, what trekking can I do?

Hoping to get some feedback before booking transit. \n\nDays 1-3: Fly into Phuket, will probably spend the first two days taking it easy. Plan to do a boat excursion. \n\nDays 4-6: ferry or bus to Krabi. Plan to do some excursions like kayaking in the mangroves, another boat tour. \n\nDays 7-10: fly from Krabi to Chiang Mai. Plan to do some nature stuff like hikes, and an elephant sanctuary. Sleeper train to Bangkok at the end of day 10. \n\nDays 10-13: Bangkok. Plan to see some of the sights in the city. \n\nDays 14-16: either flying or taking a bus to Siem Reap. Mostly just here for Angkor Wat and surrounding temples, to be honest. Overnight bus night of day 16.\n\nDays 17-20: arrive in the afternoon to Ho Chi Minh. Plan to see the tunnels and the Mekong Delta, visit the War Remnants Museum. Plan to fly to Hanoi end of Day 20.\n\nDays 21-23: I will either be taking a bus right to Ninh Binh on Day 20, or spending one night in Hanoi before taking an early bus. Plan to stay in Trang An.

It\u2019s my first trip longer than two weeks, and I\u2019m struggling a little with making sure I\u2019ve allocated appropriate time per place. Hoping to get some feedback before booking transit. \n\nDays 1-3: Fly into Phuket, will probably spend the first two days taking it easy. Plan to do a boat excursion. \n\nDays 4-6: ferry or bus to Krabi. Plan to do some excursions like kayaking in the mangroves, another boat tour. \n\nDays 7-10: fly from Krabi to Chiang Mai. Plan to do some nature stuff like hikes, and an elephant sanctuary. Sleeper train to Bangkok at the end of day 10. \n\nDays 10-13: Bangkok. Plan to see some of the sights in the city. \n\nDays 14-16: either flying or taking a bus to Siem Reap. Mostly just here for Angkor Wat and surrounding temples, to be honest. Overnight bus night of day 16.\n\nDays 17-20: arrive in the afternoon to Ho Chi Minh. Plan to see the tunnels and the Mekong Delta, visit the War Remnants Museum. Plan to fly to Hanoi end of Day 20.\n\nDays 21-23: I will either be taking a bus right to Ninh Binh on Day 20, or spending one night in Hanoi before taking an early bus. Plan to stay in Trang An. Do the hike, do a river tour, maybe some other outdoor stuff. Aiming to head to Ha Giang on the night of day 23.\n\nDays 23-27: Ha Giang loop.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm looking for some advice from some experienced solo travellers. This is my first time travelling solo for 3 months. I am taking a sabbatical from work for 3 months at the end of year. I plan on travelling from Dec till Feb. \n\nI need advice on how to think about long solo trips & how to enjoy them. I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed. \n\nThe only thing I have planned so far is my 1st month. I'm planning on visiting Japan. I have spent weeks thinking about this & brain is fried! I feel like I'm trying to plan every aspect of the trip. I'm looking into accommodation, transportation, what I want to do day by day, where I'll be eating. I like having a plan but this much planning is taking the fun out this trip. It's taking me so long to plan just Japan that I don't even know where to begin planning the other 2 months. It's turned into this tedious task.\n\nAm I doing this wrong? \n\nI think I don't know what I want from these 3 months & I'm worried I'll waste time & money on this & still not enjoy it. I feel like so far my itinerary is just ticking things off a list (go here, do this, see this). I'm worried about missing out on experiences & I'm putting too much pressure on this. \n\nI've had a few tough years & this time off is really important to me. I want to switch off & get  into local culture & just enjoy life (no work, no responsibilities,  nothing). I am wondering if I should do slow travelling. Should I spend my next 2 months in a single place, can't figure out which place. I've been thinking about visiting Australia for my 2nd month but Australia is expensive & I honestly don't have the mental capacity to even think about planning that right now. I don't even know what to do with that 3rd month. \n\nI'm also worried about being lonely on such a long solo trip, I want to meet people but that's hard for me to do at times. \n\nI just can't figure out how to think about these 3 months, how to make the most of them. I have budgeted around \u00a35K per month (excluding flights).\n\nHas anyone else felt this way? I apologise if I'm not making sense, please go easy on me, I'm new to this.  \n",

        "selftext": "Hey folks, I broke my ankle in early January (supposed to have been an extremely minor break yet at my last checkup was quoted another month with a walking boot on and ?? more time with a brace & limited function \ud83d\ude2d ). It meant canceling 2 separate active trips I'd been really looking forward to, so I'm looking to plan an upcoming trip to get my mind off of being couch-bound and replace the canceled ones. I expect I'll be in a brace but don't want to overcommit to something too active.\n\nHistorically, I've had the mindset of doing the active trips while able (long-distance hikes, bike touring, muay thai bootcamp in thailand) and saving some of the less activity intensive trips for when I'm older in 20-30 years (museums, cruises, trains, etc). So I haven't done a lot of thinking about trips that fall in the latter group before now,  but I think something less active would be a good idea. I like trips where I can deep-dive into doing/learning something in particular. Both trips I'd had planned were tennis-intensive, but other trip ideas I've had were like, those week-long \"get your intro to sailing cert\" courses or a language learning course (I speak French/Portuguese already).\n\nI'm looking for help planning something:\n\n* \\~ 6-10 days-ish but flexible there\n* mid-late April or early May this year with warm weather and hopefuly not a lot of crowds by then, I'm hoping I'll be in a brace by then and able to walk\n* not insanely crowded\n* options for being active without a lot of impact/stress on an ankle? might be a pipe-dream but I'll probably be able to bike by then (but not hiking). Stairs will be ok. Maybe I'll just bring a yoga mat and try to do something every day\n* \\*not\\* in western Europe (most of my travel experience is there)\n* isn't a foodie's tour/cruise (Me + unlimited access to food + depressive eating tendancies + not able to move around is not a good idea, lol)\n* ?? that's all I got\n\nThings that I've been thinking about:\n\n* long distance train ride (trans-Siberian railroad)?\n* maybe a road trip (regular or rent a camper van?)\n* I've never been to the middle east or most of Asia, so both sound especially appealing.\n* I think I could reasonably bike on pavement by then, but I haven't done a long-distance international bike tour yet so I'm sure I'll be comfortable with the bike box logistics of assembling/disassembling the bike at the airport\n\nThanks so much for any ideas! I swear I've been googling first but just figured I'd ask for any other off-the-beaten track ideas.",

        "selftext": "I am M29 and have always struggled with being underweight due to high metabolism. What makes it harder is that I am a vegetarian. I think the heaviest I've ever been is 65kg and that required serious effort at the gym. \n\nI wanted to share some of my struggles with food whilst solo travelling:\n\n1) Finding pure vegetarian food is insanely hard - Granted it depends where you are travelling to. South America was the worst for me, India has been the best. But generally it's a massive chore and consumes a lot of time. The language barrier can also make it harder and some cultures have different ideas of what ingredients are considered vegetarian. For example, the Thais will use fish sauce in some of their salads. I have the Happy Cow app but the restaurants are always either far away or not budget friendly. \n\n2) There is only so much you can eat out - Noone talks about this enough. Nothing can substitute for home cooked food. There is only so much restaurant cooked food you can consume. Some days I force it down me so I dont feel hungry. There is also a higher risk of becoming ill as hygiene is never guaranteed.\n\n3) Airline food - I have to tell the airline at least 24 hours in advance that I would like vegetarian meals. It's a big pain in the butt. You'd think they'd have a spare vege meal or two on board if I forget (and don't get me wrong you can get lucky) but most of the time nope. If I don't tell them on time it means no food for the next 11 hours. I have to take snacks on board just in case because there have been instances where I have notified them of my meal preferences in advance and they've still cocked it up.\n\n4) The social aspect - Restaurants are typically social venues where people eat in pairs or larger groups. Sitting alone can be quite intimidating and it makes it harder to enjoy your food. Your phone can also become a massive distraction.\n\n5) Eating takes a significant part of your day. Researching places to eat, going there, finding out that it's shut because the info on Google is wrong or outdated, finding another place close by etc etc. I feel the struggle tenfold as a vegetarian. It's exhausting.\n\nI hope I do not get attacked for coming across as a negative person and my travel experiences have been positive in many other aspects but the seasoned travellers amongst us will know it's not always sunshine and rainbows. I have experienced all of these things and wanted to open the floor for other people to express their thoughts and ways to overcome such struggles.",

        "selftext": "31F. Been a long-time lurker here, and with my travels finally coming to an end, I want to nudge all those fence-sitters contemplating whether to quit their jobs for long-term travel\u2014go do it! You\u2019re only young once! Enough has been said about this, so I\u2019d like to share my two cents.\n\nI started traveling solo and internationally only after my breakup, about 4 years ago. I had traveled the vast length and breadth of my country before, but not solo, and definitely not for an extended duration.\n\nThat familiar existential dread *(Millennials ftw!)* mixed with the constant, deep-rooted urge to see the world \u2014\u00a0*\u201cjust another cog in the corporate machine\"*,\u00a0*\u201cI need to find myself\"*,\u00a0*\u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger\"*,\u00a0*\"If not now, then when?\u201d*\u00a0\u2014those thoughts that creep in when we spiral down the quarter-life crisis rabbit hole. But quitting a well-coveted job to follow your passion\u2014especially when you\u2019ve been taught to measure your worth by your grades and career\u2014isn\u2019t exactly commonplace where I come from. My folks were scandalised at first\u2014their nerdy, straight-A kid choosing the road over the corporate ladder! But eventually, they came around.\n\nAnd boy oh boy! These past few months have been amazing and would not trade them for anything. The unexpected encounters, finding kindness in the most unlikely places, the (mis)adventures, doing things I never thought I could, and experiences that shattered stereotypes, in the best way possible!\n\n**Countries covered:**\n\n* Malaysia \u2192 Singapore \u2192 Hong Kong \u2192 Netherlands\u2192 Belgium \u2192 France \u2192 Germany \u2192 Italy \u2192 Switzerland \u2192 Iceland \u2192 Spain \u2192 Mexico \u2192 Peru \u2192 US \u2192 Thailand ...\n\n**Kindness from Strangers**\n\n* From the kind stranger who paid for my food at a small roadside stall in Hong Kong (after I realised I had misplaced my wallet) and casually driving off in his Merc, to the concerned police officer in Amsterdam who dropped everything to help me get to a pharmacy after I fractured my thumb\u2014on my\u00a0*first day*\u00a0in Europe.\n* From the lady who helped carry my luggage on the train to Brussels, to the thoughtful hostel rep at Wombat Munich who let me check in at 7 AM because I was struggling after an overnight Flixbus ride from Saarbr\u00fccken.\n* From the French grandma in Colmar who was determined to help me in English despite barely speaking a word of it, to the kind soul in Mexico City who took a 30-minute detour just to help me reach my Coyoac\u00e1n cycling tour group after a delayed flight.\n* From the bus driver in Iceland who agreed to carry a package for me from V\u00edk to Reykjav\u00edk at\u00a0*midnight*, to the salon lady in Ollantaytambo who offered her hair dryer so I could dry off after getting completely soaked at Machu Picchu.\n\n**Few of the many firsts**\n\n* Cycled inter-city (to Giethoorn); tasted my first Argentine pork ribs; went hours without internet in Brussels and relied on strangers for navigation; had my first authentic French baguettes, banettes, and Alsace wine; saw a seatbelt-less Uber driver (yup\u2014my Uber driver to Munich airport); and witnessed my first-ever rainbow over a mountain in Lauterbrunnen.\n* Iceland gave me many: North Atlantic sunsets and sunrises, fermented shark, Icelandic lamb shank, playful Icelandic horses, and my first hot water spring; first snow of the season \\[No Aurora sightings :(\\]\n* Had my first churros, first Peruvian meal (in Madrid!); first Spanish omelette and goat cheese in Toledo; first live Royal Rumble (Lucha Libre!) and street tacos in CDMX; \n* Did my first 5,000-metre trek in Cusco; saw alpacas and llamas; spotted penguins in Islas Ballestas; had my first Inka Chips (iykyk); made my first cocktail at a bar in Lima; went sandboarding for the first time; and crossed one of Thailand\u2019s largest waterfalls in Chiang Mai.\n\n**Misadventures**\n\n* Phone screen shattered on Day 1 of my Eurotrip.\n* Missed my train in Paris.\n* Almost missed the last bus from Toledo to Madrid.\n* Lost the SD card with all my footage up till Iceland.\n* Got caught in a train strike in Venice that derailed my entire plan to Chur.\n* And yes, boarded the Bernina Express one minute before departure\u2014because I was waiting at the wrong station in Tirano.\n* Apparently Seville is known to be bright and sunny throughout the year - the day I visited was one of the rainiest days \\[It was the same torrential rain that took a lot of lives in Valencia\\].\n* Got completely soaked\u2014trekking boots and all. Incessant rain and thick fog in Machu Picchu. The rain ponchos? Useless.\n* High Altitude hit for the first time while doing the 7-Lakes trek in Peru\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Fellow travellers, what were your firsts, kindnesses, or misadventures?

If it's worth a visit I'd be happy to lose a night in HK. And if so what is the best area to stay/hostel recomendations?\n\nWhats the best way to book the train tickets?

Will most people be on longer gap years/month long trips, or will there be lots of people on shorter 2 week or so long trips like me? I suppose it would be nice to meet people who I end up seeing in multiple different cities, but I'm guessing that's unlikely so it'll be new people everywhere, which is fine too, but just means I won't really get to know anyone as I'd only see them for 5 days at most.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

The trip will run from October 2025 to early June 2026, so about 8 months total.\n\nI'm not trying to rush through places. I want a slow, immersive experience. Think: street food, hostels, public transport, cultural sites, nature, and a few organized treks and diving trips thrown in. Definitely not luxury travel.\n\nHere\u2019s my rough itinerary and how long I plan to spend in each country:\n\n* India \u2013 6 weeks\n* Nepal \u2013 1 month\n* Thailand \u2013 6 weeks\n* Laos \u2013 3 weeks\n* Cambodia \u2013 3 weeks\n* Vietnam \u2013 1 month\n* Malaysia \u2013 3 weeks\n* Indonesia \u2013 4 weeks\n* Japan \u2013 3 weeks (more of a \u201cif I still have money at the end, why not?\u201d addition rather than a fixed part of the plan)\n\nI asked ChatGPT to help me build a realistic budget for this kind of trip in 2025/2026, and the estimate came out to around **$15,000 USD** (\\~60,000 PLN). That includes:\n\n* All daily expenses (accommodation, food, transport, etc.)\n* Flights (international and regional)\n* Visas, insurance, and basic gear\n* Pre-planned bigger activities (listed below)\n\nBigger activities already factored into the budget:\n\n* 2 liveaboard diving trips (\\~$1,000 each \u2013 Thailand & Indonesia)\n* 4 organized treks:\n   * Everest Base Camp in Nepal (12 days, \\~$1,400)\n   * 5-day trek in Laos (\\~$260)\n   * 3-day trek in Indonesia (\\~$285)\n   * 3-day trek in Vietnam (\\~$360)\n\nAll of those include food and accommodation, so I excluded those days from the daily budget calculations. I found the treks on [**bookatrekking.com**](http://bookatrekking.com) \u2014 anyone here used them and can vouch for it (or warn against it)?\n\nI\u2019ll have a modest financial buffer on top of the 15k, and I\u2019ll also be getting some passive income while I travel (apartment rental), so running out of money mid-trip isn\u2019t a huge concern.\n\nSo here are my main questions:\n\n* Is this budget realistic for the kind of travel I\u2019m doing (hostels, street food, basic transport)?\n* Does my route make sense weather-wise? I tried to avoid monsoon seasons where possible but I'd appreciate a second opinion.\n* Are there any obvious red flags in terms of time spent in each country or overall flow?\n* Has anyone here used [bookatrekking.com](http://bookatrekking.com) and would you recommend it (or not)?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or advice from people who\u2019ve done similar trips.",

        "selftext": "I just went to Cairo for a week and thought I'd provide my trip report to document the great experience I had. A bit of a long post so I start with a short summary of my trip, then a more detailed account, and finally some overall impressions and tips.\n\n(Disclaimer, I am a man, so I'm not trying to discount any negative experiences other people especially women have had traveling in Egypt. Just giving you guys my personal experience and want to provide a positive/balanced account on a destination that I see get a lot of flak.)\n\nI just had a week to travel so I decided to stick to Cairo and Alexandria, and save Luxor/Aswan etc for another time to not spread myself too thin. I'm really interested in cities and the more \"recent\" (compared to Ancient Egypt) history as well so I was perfectly happy filling my time in Cairo as it is a very historical city with a lot to see. It was also Ramadan so I was interested in seeing the vibe of the city during this time. Overall, my expectations were exceeded and I really enjoyed my trip.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere's a summary of the itinerary and the places I visited:\n\n1 night in Alexandria, 5 nights in Cairo.\n\n**Alexandria:**\n- Bibliotheca Alexandrina\n- Catacombs\n- Corniche\n- Local neighborhood markets\n\n**Cairo:**\n- Coptic Cairo \n- St. Simon Monastery\n- Garbage City\n- Maadi\n- Pyramids of Giza\n- Grand Egyptian Museum\n- Zamalek\n- Islamic Cairo (including Al Azhar Mosque, Khan Al Khalili, and Bab Zuwayla)\n- City of the Dead\n- Al Azhar Park\n\n**Transportation:**\n- Uber for taxis\n- inDrive for taxis/longer itineraries\n- GoBus for intercity travel\n- Cairo Metro was great - cheap, clean, frequent, and safe\n- Microbuses - shared minibuses that seemed very frequent along major arteries and often went to a Metro station. Only cost 5 EGP. Might be hard to use without Arabic, but can be convenient. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere's a more detailed account:\n\n**Day 1: Alexandria**\n\nI flew into Cairo and arrived at 5 in the morning, with the plan to head straight to Alexandria to meet a friend. The airport was a little chaotic but getting through it was surprisingly quick. Bring $25 and a pen for the visa on arrival and immigration form. \n\nI took an Uber from the airport; had to turn down some taxi drivers but no one was aggressive, just tell them you have a car coming. Tip for taking Ubers: learn the Arabic numerals, because the license plates often only have Arabic numerals on them. \n\nMy initial impression of Cairo was that it looked visually really unique and interesting - it was my first trip to the Middle East/Africa, and the desert environment + the monochromatic architectural aesthetic combined with the scale of the city was something I'd never really seen before and had me really excited to come back and explore after my detour to Alexandria.\n\nI took a 3 hour Go Bus to Alexandria which was pretty smooth and comfortable, and from the Alexandria bus station (which was admittedly a little chaotic) I took a yellow taxi to the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The taxi driver poached me as soon as I got off the bus so I was a little wary, but I was fine with the price he gave me so I just went with him (100 EGP = 2 USD). But don't be afraid to say no or haggle. \n\nI met my friend at the library, which is a grand, airy, modern building with some art and historical exhibits in it, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria. Following this we went the Roman-era Catacombs which were also quite cool. We walked around the nearby neighborhood which was getting pretty lively as people were starting to do their shopping in preparation for sundown. We walked around the Bahary neighborhood as well and wandered through the market there, and eventually made our way to the seaside for sunset. All in all Alexandria was nice, a bit chiller than Cairo, and a good introduction to Egypt for me. It was quite hard to find food as it was Ramadan, but this was expected.\n\n**Day 2: Coptic Cairo and Garbage City**\n\nWe took a car to Cairo in the morning, which cost 900 EGP = 30 USD. You can book a car through the inDrive app, which allows you to set a desired itinerary and price and then view and choose from offers from drivers. Super cool and convenient system, and a private taxi ride between Alexandria and Cairo is still cheaper than a train ticket for foreigners. \n\nOnce in Cairo, we checked into our hostel downtown (near Talaat Harb Square - there are a lot of hostels in this area), and then took the Metro (8 EGP = ~$0.20) over to Coptic Cairo, which was quite touristy but the old churches and cemetery were still very interesting. We wandered around on our own, ending at the Souq al Fustat nearby which had a good selection of handmade items/ gifts to bring home. \n\nNext we took an Uber over to the St. Simon Monastery which is a cool church with an amphitheatre in a cave, tucked away requiring a drive through the crowded and hectic streets of the \"Garbage City\". The Monastery is very nice, just expect a fair number of tourists there (a lot of big groups coming in on tour buses, which I didn't expect here as I kept seeing this listed online as a less visited tourist site in Cairo). They also have a zipline there lol. We walked through the Garbage City a bit after checking out the Monastery. Again it's a pretty hectic neighborhood, and not the cleanest or more pleasant to walk in, but really interesting to see the informal system of garbage collection and recycling (especially as an urban planner myself). It was also interesting to explore a predominantly Christian neighborhood. We eventually caught a microbus who agreed to take us all the way to Maadi where we grabbed dinner. This part of the city was less interesting as a tourist - Maadi is relatively suburban and is an area popular with expats, with a number of international restos and chains here. \n\n**Day 3: Pyramids**\n\nToday we went to the Pyramids, which were honestly more impressive than I expected. A lot of tourists as expected, but still a spectacular sight. Lots of guys trying to get you to buy camel rides so if that bothers you idk lol you just have to keep saying no but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. We did end up giving in and doing a camel ride just for the experience lol but they're quite uncomfortable and just as slow as walking so I wouldn't really recommend. \n\nWe spent a few hours here and then took an Uber to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, which has most of its exhibits but is still not yet fully set up. The museum was cool, although the organization of the exhibits could've been a bit better and it didn't feel like there was much actual information conveyed in the exhibits (like I didn't really learn anything about the history, it was a lot more just looking at cool old things). Next time I would like to check out the Museum of Egyptian Civilization.\n\nNext we Ubered to Islamic Cairo because we wanted to do iftar here. We ended up at Al Azhar Mosque where they were setting up tables and chairs outside. A man told us to sit down so we did and joined a bunch of people who were sitting waiting for iftar. It was a sweet moment and the kids sitting next to us were super curious and friendly. We were given dates, rice, beans, and meat which we ate along with everyone else at sunset. Afterwards we got some tea and sweets on one of the nearby narrow commercial streets which at this point was very lively.\n\n**Day 4-6: Exploring Cairo**\n\nMy friend left so the last three days I spent solo in Cairo. I was originally thinking to go further afield and check out Saqqara and maybe the new capital that's been under construction, but I was experiencing really bad cat allergies from my hostel that were making me feel really tired and unwell so I didn't stray too far these days. \n\nI went to Zamalek, which is a chiller more upscale neighborhood. I spent my time just walking around, buying some souvenirs, eating at Zooba which was open for lunch during Ramadan, and getting delicious sweets from Mandarine Koueider nearby. \n\nI also returned to Islamic Cairo to see the sights during the daytime. The area is really interesting to wander around with more pedestrian-scale streets and old old buildings. So much history and really feels like you're somewhere unique with a storied past. \n\nI went up Bab Zuwayla which has a really great view over the old city, and I was the only person there at first. I also wandered around the narrow shopping streets nearby around Al Moiz and Khan Al Khalili. This portion had more tourists but still didn't feel overly touristed. The covered textile market south of Bab Zuwayla is cool, and I walked further south even beyond that were it became a very local market street which was super lively and stimulating to walk through. Vendors selling all kinds of produce and meat and bread and things. Young guys whizzing by on bicycles balancing long wooden frames on their heads with dozens of rounds of flatbread laid on top.\n\n I spent a good amount of time along Al Moiz exploring the shops and checking out the old streets and buildings. I also walked from here to the City of the Dead, which is a large necropolis where people have set up homes in the mausoleums. The walk from Islamic Cairo is not the nicest walk as it's basically along a highway for part of it but there's a pedestrian overpass that spits you out right at the entrance to the neighborhood. The view from the overpass is awesome, looking over the mausoleums with the beautiful old mosques poking out above them. Super interesting area to walk through - feels so different from the rest of the city. Very peaceful and I didn't see a lot of people, but definitely felt like an outsider and only saw like 2 tourists while I was there. I walked to Sultan Qaytbey Mosque, wandered a little bit, and then Ubered from here to Al Azhar Park. Very difficult to get an Uber from here, I would've been better off just getting a tuktuk from by the mosque. \n\nAl Azhar Park was my last stop, and is a nice green oasis in the city. Good views since it's on a hill, and a nice area to chill and regain some energy after walking around so much.\n\n\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n**Overall impressions and tips:**\n\n\u2014 Cairo was super cool. Such interesting glimpses of life in a one of a kind city with so much history and so much energy. A great place to wander around and great food too. \n\n\n\u2014 The Ramadan atmosphere was super cool to witness, with the city being fairly chill during the day and very lively late at night. It's like the analog to Christmas season, with decorations and Ramadan music playing everywhere. Food was definitely hard to find during the day, so definitely get a hostel that provides breakfast if you're traveling during Ramadan. Also keep in mind that most tourist sites close early so plan accordingly.\n\n\n\u2014 Food to try: koshary; taameya, the local version of falafel; pickled eggplant; molokhiya, a jute leaf soup; bamiya, an okra stew; and of course the sweets! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\n\u2014 Definitely helpful to learn a little bit of Egyptian Arabic as I didn't find there to be much English spoken. Learn how to say the numbers, learn how to ask how much (bekam), learn basic greetings and thank yous, learn how to ask for things (3andak..., momken...), yes/no/okay (aywa, la, meshi). Knowing some basics will go a long way to make your experience a little easier. \n\n\n\u2014 Egypt was very affordable, more affordable than I expected. For meals you can expect to spend anywhere from 10 to 200 EGP (divide by 50 to convert to USD). Ubers were usually 50-100 EGP. Dorms in hostels were around 250 EGP while private rooms in hostels were around 750 EGP.  Honestly felt even cheaper than India. \n\n\n\u2014 The Cairo Metro was great. Clean, super cheap, and very frequent. Also quite convenient for many of the places I was going to. Just tell the ticket booth what station you're going to and they'll give you the appropriate ticket. \n\n\n\u2014 Maybe I got lucky but I really didn't encounter much in the way of hassling or scams. I was asked for baksheesh a handful of times at mosques and other sites, but it's pretty easy to deal with (just say no or pretend you don't understand or just give them a little bit of money and be firm and say no if they ask for more). It was not frequent enough to mar my experience. People who were trying to sell me things were pretty easy to turn down, and I never felt unsafe (again disclaimer I am a man). Maybe it being Ramadan also had something to do with it, I'm not sure. \n\n\n\u2014 Go in with an open mind and be flexible. It's not a cozy and curated old European town or a well organized Japanese city, so you have to take it for what it is and be open to enjoying that. Think the scale and energy and palpable history of Istanbul, with the exciting chaos and overstimulation of a major Indian city. Don't go in expecting a pristine, calm city that caters to tourists. But if you're adaptable and interested in major world cities, seeing daily life in the largest city in the Arab world, and checking out Egypt's non-Ancient history, I absolutely recommend spending time in Cairo.

Just giving you guys my personal experience and want to provide a positive/balanced account on a destination that I see get a lot of flak.)\n\nI just had a week to travel so I decided to stick to Cairo and Alexandria, and save Luxor/Aswan etc for another time to not spread myself too thin. I'm really interested in cities and the more \"recent\" (compared to Ancient Egypt) history as well so I was perfectly happy filling my time in Cairo as it is a very historical city with a lot to see. It was also Ramadan so I was interested in seeing the vibe of the city during this time. Overall, my expectations were exceeded and I really enjoyed my trip.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere's a summary of the itinerary and the places I visited:\n\n1 night in Alexandria, 5 nights in Cairo.\n\n**Alexandria:**\n- Bibliotheca Alexandrina\n- Catacombs\n- Corniche\n- Local neighborhood markets\n\n**Cairo:**\n- Coptic Cairo \n- St. Simon Monastery\n- Garbage City\n- Maadi\n- Pyramids of Giza\n- Grand Egyptian Museum\n- Zamalek\n- Islamic Cairo (including Al Azhar Mosque, Khan Al Khalili, and Bab Zuwayla)\n- City of the Dead\n- Al Azhar Park\n\n**Transportation:**\n- Uber for taxis\n- inDrive for taxis/longer itineraries\n- GoBus for intercity travel\n- Cairo Metro was great - cheap, clean, frequent, and safe\n- Microbuses - shared minibuses that seemed very frequent along major arteries and often went to a Metro station. Only cost 5 EGP. Might be hard to use without Arabic, but can be convenient. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHere's a more detailed account:\n\n**Day 1: Alexandria**\n\nI flew into Cairo and arrived at 5 in the morning, with the plan to head straight to Alexandria to meet a friend. The airport was a little chaotic but getting through it was surprisingly quick. Bring $25 and a pen for the visa on arrival and immigration form. \n\nI took an Uber from the airport; had to turn down some taxi drivers but no one was aggressive, just tell them you have a car coming. Tip for taking Ubers: learn the Arabic numerals, because the license plates often only have Arabic numerals on them. \n\nMy initial impression of Cairo was that it looked visually really unique and interesting - it was my first trip to the Middle East/Africa, and the desert environment + the monochromatic architectural aesthetic combined with the scale of the city was something I'd never really seen before and had me really excited to come back and explore after my detour to Alexandria.\n\nI took a 3 hour Go Bus to Alexandria which was pretty smooth and comfortable, and from the Alexandria bus station (which was admittedly a little chaotic) I took a yellow taxi to the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The taxi driver poached me as soon as I got off the bus so I was a little wary, but I was fine with the price he gave me so I just went with him (100 EGP = 2 USD). But don't be afraid to say no or haggle. \n\nI met my friend at the library, which is a grand, airy, modern building with some art and historical exhibits in it, commemorating the original Library of Alexandria. Following this we went the Roman-era Catacombs which were also quite cool. We walked around the nearby neighborhood which was getting pretty lively as people were starting to do their shopping in preparation for sundown. We walked around the Bahary neighborhood as well and wandered through the market there, and eventually made our way to the seaside for sunset. All in all Alexandria was nice, a bit chiller than Cairo, and a good introduction to Egypt for me. It was quite hard to find food as it was Ramadan, but this was expected.\n\n**Day 2: Coptic Cairo and Garbage City**\n\nWe took a car to Cairo in the morning, which cost 900 EGP = 30 USD. You can book a car through the inDrive app, which allows you to set a desired itinerary and price and then view and choose from offers from drivers. Super cool and convenient system, and a private taxi ride between Alexandria and Cairo is still cheaper than a train ticket for foreigners. \n\nOnce in Cairo, we checked into our hostel downtown (near Talaat Harb Square - there are a lot of hostels in this area), and then took the Metro (8 EGP = ~$0.20) over to Coptic Cairo, which was quite touristy but the old churches and cemetery were still very interesting. We wandered around on our own, ending at the Souq al Fustat nearby which had a good selection of handmade items/ gifts to bring home. \n\nNext we took an Uber over to the St. Simon Monastery which is a cool church with an amphitheatre in a cave, tucked away requiring a drive through the crowded and hectic streets of the \"Garbage City\". The Monastery is very nice, just expect a fair number of tourists there (a lot of big groups coming in on tour buses, which I didn't expect here as I kept seeing this listed online as a less visited tourist site in Cairo). They also have a zipline there lol. We walked through the Garbage City a bit after checking out the Monastery. Again it's a pretty hectic neighborhood, and not the cleanest or more pleasant to walk in, but really interesting to see the informal system of garbage collection and recycling (especially as an urban planner myself). It was also interesting to explore a predominantly Christian neighborhood. We eventually caught a microbus who agreed to take us all the way to Maadi where we grabbed dinner. This part of the city was less interesting as a tourist - Maadi is relatively suburban and is an area popular with expats, with a number of international restos and chains here. \n\n**Day 3: Pyramids**\n\nToday we went to the Pyramids, which were honestly more impressive than I expected. A lot of tourists as expected, but still a spectacular sight. Lots of guys trying to get you to buy camel rides so if that bothers you idk lol you just have to keep saying no but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. We did end up giving in and doing a camel ride just for the experience lol but they're quite uncomfortable and just as slow as walking so I wouldn't really recommend. \n\nWe spent a few hours here and then took an Uber to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, which has most of its exhibits but is still not yet fully set up. The museum was cool, although the organization of the exhibits could've been a bit better and it didn't feel like there was much actual information conveyed in the exhibits (like I didn't really learn anything about the history, it was a lot more just looking at cool old things). Next time I would like to check out the Museum of Egyptian Civilization.\n\nNext we Ubered to Islamic Cairo because we wanted to do iftar here. We ended up at Al Azhar Mosque where they were setting up tables and chairs outside. A man told us to sit down so we did and joined a bunch of people who were sitting waiting for iftar. It was a sweet moment and the kids sitting next to us were super curious and friendly. We were given dates, rice, beans, and meat which we ate along with everyone else at sunset. Afterwards we got some tea and sweets on one of the nearby narrow commercial streets which at this point was very lively.\n\n**Day 4-6: Exploring Cairo**\n\nMy friend left so the last three days I spent solo in Cairo. I was originally thinking to go further afield and check out Saqqara and maybe the new capital that's been under construction, but I was experiencing really bad cat allergies from my hostel that were making me feel really tired and unwell so I didn't stray too far these days. \n\nI went to Zamalek, which is a chiller more upscale neighborhood. I spent my time just walking around, buying some souvenirs, eating at Zooba which was open for lunch during Ramadan, and getting delicious sweets from Mandarine Koueider nearby. \n\nI also returned to Islamic Cairo to see the sights during the daytime. The area is really interesting to wander around with more pedestrian-scale streets and old old buildings. So much history and really feels like you're somewhere unique with a storied past. \n\nI went up Bab Zuwayla which has a really great view over the old city, and I was the only person there at first. I also wandered around the narrow shopping streets nearby around Al Moiz and Khan Al Khalili. This portion had more tourists but still didn't feel overly touristed. The covered textile market south of Bab Zuwayla is cool, and I walked further south even beyond that were it became a very local market street which was super lively and stimulating to walk through. Vendors selling all kinds of produce and meat and bread and things. Young guys whizzing by on bicycles balancing long wooden frames on their heads with dozens of rounds of flatbread laid on top.\n\n I spent a good amount of time along Al Moiz exploring the shops and checking out the old streets and buildings. I also walked from here to the City of the Dead, which is a large necropolis where people have set up homes in the mausoleums. The walk from Islamic Cairo is not the nicest walk as it's basically along a highway for part of it but there's a pedestrian overpass that spits you out right at the entrance to the neighborhood. The view from the overpass is awesome, looking over the mausoleums with the beautiful old mosques poking out above them. Super interesting area to walk through - feels so different from the rest of the city. Very peaceful and I didn't see a lot of people, but definitely felt like an outsider and only saw like 2 tourists while I was there. I walked to Sultan Qaytbey Mosque, wandered a little bit, and then Ubered from here to Al Azhar Park. Very difficult to get an Uber from here, I would've been better off just getting a tuktuk from by the mosque. \n\nAl Azhar Park was my last stop, and is a nice green oasis in the city. Good views since it's on a hill, and a nice area to chill and regain some energy after walking around so much.\n\n\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n**Overall impressions and tips:**\n\n\u2014 Cairo was super cool. Such interesting glimpses of life in a one of a kind city with so much history and so much energy. A great place to wander around and great food too. \n\n\n\u2014 The Ramadan atmosphere was super cool to witness, with the city being fairly chill during the day and very lively late at night. It's like the analog to Christmas season, with decorations and Ramadan music playing everywhere. Food was definitely hard to find during the day, so definitely get a hostel that provides breakfast if you're traveling during Ramadan. Also keep in mind that most tourist sites close early so plan accordingly.\n\n\n\u2014 Food to try: koshary; taameya, the local version of falafel; pickled eggplant; molokhiya, a jute leaf soup; bamiya, an okra stew; and of course the sweets! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\n\u2014 Definitely helpful to learn a little bit of Egyptian Arabic as I didn't find there to be much English spoken. Learn how to say the numbers, learn how to ask how much (bekam), learn basic greetings and thank yous, learn how to ask for things (3andak..., momken...), yes/no/okay (aywa, la, meshi). Knowing some basics will go a long way to make your experience a little easier. \n\n\n\u2014 Egypt was very affordable, more affordable than I expected. For meals you can expect to spend anywhere from 10 to 200 EGP (divide by 50 to convert to USD). Ubers were usually 50-100 EGP. Dorms in hostels were around 250 EGP while private rooms in hostels were around 750 EGP.  Honestly felt even cheaper than India. \n\n\n\u2014 The Cairo Metro was great. Clean, super cheap, and very frequent. Also quite convenient for many of the places I was going to. Just tell the ticket booth what station you're going to and they'll give you the appropriate ticket. \n\n\n\u2014 Maybe I got lucky but I really didn't encounter much in the way of hassling or scams. I was asked for baksheesh a handful of times at mosques and other sites, but it's pretty easy to deal with (just say no or pretend you don't understand or just give them a little bit of money and be firm and say no if they ask for more). It was not frequent enough to mar my experience. People who were trying to sell me things were pretty easy to turn down, and I never felt unsafe (again disclaimer I am a man). Maybe it being Ramadan also had something to do with it, I'm not sure. \n\n\n\u2014 Go in with an open mind and be flexible. It's not a cozy and curated old European town or a well organized Japanese city, so you have to take it for what it is and be open to enjoying that. Think the scale and energy and palpable history of Istanbul, with the exciting chaos and overstimulation of a major Indian city. Don't go in expecting a pristine, calm city that caters to tourists. But if you're adaptable and interested in major world cities, seeing daily life in the largest city in the Arab world, and checking out Egypt's non-Ancient history, I absolutely recommend spending time in Cairo.

        "selftext": "8 Day Okinawa Trip Report\n\nJanuary 4 2025 \u2013 January 12 2025\n\nContext: I am flying in from Osaka, Japan and flew out to Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nReason of this trip report: There wasn\u2019t much info on Okinawa when I was researching. I really enjoyed Okinawa and the whole time the places occupancy rate were under 25% of capacity. The locals are kind and heavily rely on tourism. More tourist should consider Okinawa because there is a lot to offer and is under capacity.\n\nPlan: I was going to stay in Naha city for the convenience, being close to airport and more Airbnb options. I was going to explore more of south mainland Okinawa because its more accessible with bus. I was going to take a tour bus to view some highlights of northern Okinawa. I was going to skip the islands and very north of Okinawa because I didn\u2019t want to drive and there is already a lot to see in 8 days. I feel I can always go back to Okinawa so I don\u2019t need to see the entirety the first time.\n\nJanuary 4^(th)\n\nFlew in to Naha Airport at 5p.m. I checked in my Airbnb at 6:30p.m\n\nNaha Kokusai Dori Shopping Street: Very lively markets. There is more public music from restaurants. There are singers busking. There are a lot of markets and busy streets connected together. You can walk this area for a long time. I ate at a bar and oddly I was charged additional 300 yen table fee. First time hearing this fee. I googled it later and it\u2019s a thing here for locals too. I never saw the table fee at restaurants in Okinawa.\n\nJanuary 5^(th)\n\nOkinawa craft industry promotion center: Interesting concept. Part museum displaying crafts made in Okinawa. Part store. Part workshops area for weaving fabric and other crafts. Part private studios where artisans can make product out of. There is beautiful greenery in this area too. Free\n\n\u00a0\n\nJapanese navel headquarters visitors center: Alot of photos and video on the history of the Okinawa battle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFormer Japanese navy underground headquarters: 600Yen. Large tunnel network which some was restored for public to see.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa outlet mall ashibinaa: Odd to see a mix of semi luxury shopping with kids activities you would see at a carnival. Bouncy castles, train rides, small spinning amusement park rides.\n\nIias Okinawa Toyosaki. Has the generic stuff plus a cat caf\u00e9, connected to an aquarium, food court and many children\u2019s activities. In mall playgrounds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChura-san Beach: Nice little beach. I left early because it started to rain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 6^(th)\n\nOkinawa Hip Hop Bus Tour through Klook. It runs 2 days a week. On that day there were 13 Japanese tourist and 2 foreign tourist. Total 15 people went and the bus can hold 40. Tour guide was friendly and spoke Japanese and English for us 2 foreigners.\n\nVery fast and fun. There is no way I could reach half those places in a day with public bus.\n\nThe weather wasn\u2019t good so we skipped glass boat at kariyushi beach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNeopark: It kind of old and past it\u2019s prime but I liked the novelty.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa churaumi aquarium: I like this aquarium because it showed the big tank with whale shark and mantas. There wasn\u2019t \u201cfiller\u201d exhibits with goldfish and other small creatures which I already seen a lot of. There were few big exhibits with educational exhibits and logistic exhibits on how they capture and move the whale.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBise-fukugi tree road. There was a lot there to see. There was a scooter rental and a beach. I was only there for 30 minutes so I missed a lot of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYachimun no sato is a pottery place. There is a huge outdoor kiln that fires 2 times a year. There were a lot of pottery stores there and workshop. The prices were 2000-3000 yen for a plate or cup but its handmade.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican Village. Many large stores and buildings in an American style. There is lots of LEDS and there again things little kids would like. Such as large character statues.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Japanese are on time to get back to the tour bus. One Japanese ran and was panting when coming back to the tour bus when 3 minutes late, apologizing and bowing when entering back into the bus. The bus driver greets you every time you enter and exit the bus.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 7^(th)\n\nKarate museum. Turns out its a dojo and the owner lives upstairs in the building. There are no drop ins for the museum inside. No one answered the door when I range the bell.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural archaeological center. There was 2 exhibition rooms. About the origins of Okinawa. There wasn\u2019t much and little was translated into English. Free.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFarmers market yonabaru agarihama market: I thought it was a farmers market like said in google maps buts it\u2019s more of a grocery store. There they sold grain by the kg. There was a machine and attendant there ready to package your grain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarine plaza agarihama: A strip mall with large department stores. There was a daiso there which many items were 120yen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 8^(th)\n\nmanga souko urasoe: second hand store 2 floors. Lots of clothes, instruments, DVDs, video games.\n\n\u00a0\n\nmakeman urasoe main branch. Very large department store.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMinatogawa stateside town: The concept is each street is a U.S. state. There are many units that are cafes, retail, tattoo shop, craft workshop. There wasn\u2019t much going on. Many stores are closed and the prices are high.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural library: Library is floor 2-4. Tourist info center was in same building. Naha bus terminal was also here. I read short book about Japanese moving to Brazil after WW2 because at the same time Brazil abolish slavery so cheap labor was needed in the coffee plantations.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMatsuyama park: There was a tribute to a karate guy there. It was odd that the men\u2019s and women public washrooms entrances facing infront each other. Men can see straight into the women bathroom and vice versa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 9\n\nOkinawa world: Kinda touristy. The underground cave was nice. Staff took a free picture when we entered. When we exited we scanned the QR code and they printed a free small black and white photo. They offered an already printed and made color photo for 1000 yen. I declined and they threw the photo out. There was a snake show, fruit garden, many shops, glass demonstration.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI walked past a lot of sugar cane farms to\n\n\u00a0\n\nOjima island: Very small. I could walk it in 20 minutes. Nice views and restaurant. There were families teaching their toddler how to fish and kids baseball game happening there. There was sign saying glass bottom boat but most stores were closed when I was there at 7p.m.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 10^(th)\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural peace memorial museum: Very large, clean and comprehensive of the battle of Okinawa. Has testimonials, videos, artifacts, human scale replicas of stores, markets in the time after ww2. There was also an observatory tower.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeace memorial park. There was also an outdoor touchscreen to help you find where each person was located.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa Peace hall. A large Budda, paintings, garden and butterfly green house. All for 300 yen. I never went to see butterflies because its often $15+ in North America.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the memorials much at the south end because it started raining more and my umbrella broke.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHimeyuri cenotaph: Beautiful garden with sad story. I bought flowers for 300 yen.\n\nHimeyuri peace museum: very sad. The testimonials are very detail and immersive. I left early\n\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to cry so much.\n\nRyukyu glass village: There were demonstrations, stores, restaurants workshops. Very large.\n\nJanuary 11^(th)\n\nI walked to Naha bus terminal to get a refund on my okica card. There was a 200 yen fee. I got back around 1300 yen. Today and tomorrow I stop using buses and only monorail which I can pay with pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShurijo castle: I saw a lot of castles in mainland Japan so I didn\u2019t pay the 400 yen to enter. I walked through the outer castle area towards\u2026\n\nKinjo Stone road: The stone road was beside residential area. It must be tiresome to live on that rocky road. I found a marble on this road and kept it as souvenir.\n\nTamauden: I went in for 300 yen. There wasn\u2019t much to see but it wasn\u2019t expensive. Tamauden is a tomb of a royal family. There is also a beautiful garden here. There is a road with a row of old lush trees on each side. It is a nice picture spot that is empty a few minutes at a time.\n\nShuri Ryusen: Google maps said tourist attraction but its really a store on main level, coral painting t-shirts on 2^(nd)\u00a0level. There was so many tables on second floor, the capacity was 40 people but I was the only one there.\n\nOkinawa prefectural museum and art museum: The museum was 450 yen and art was 400 yen. I only saw the permanent exhibits. The museum was ok, pretty large and show a good summary of Okinawa. The history, artifacts, nature. The art was small. There were very few exhibits. 3 rooms. 1 media, 1 sculpture, 1 paintings.\n\nI walked through San-a-naha main place. Its a big mall with the usual.\n\nJanuary 12^(th)\n\nWoke up at 4am. Had breakfast from 7-11. Walk to nearest monorail and went straight to Naha airport via pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFood: It was my first time seeing Okinawa onigiri with egg and spam and was delicious. There are so many local restaurants. I only ate at a few restaurants and ordered there everyday. Once I find spots I like, I eat there the whole trip.\n\nI ate \u70c8\u706b\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u6696\u66ae \u90a3\u8987\u958b\u5357\u5e97 often. The owner has high standards and was patient in explaining to me how to order and pick noodle options. Owner remade my fried rice because an apprentice made a small mistake. Owner remade it himself. I didn\u2019t complain or ask for it to be remade. 450 yen fried rice. 850 yen ramen.\n\nI ate breakfast at Norichan 550 yen for the breakfast combo. I was really impressed with the discipline of this restaurant. The staff huddled in a circle. Someone gave instructions and staff enthusiastically said \u201chai!\u201d and starting working with intention.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTransportation:\n\nThe monorail coverage is short and a bit more expensive than Tokyo. 2-3 stops can be 300 yen. The monorail takes pasmo, Suica and Okica. The buses only use Okica card which you can buy at any monorail station. Including Naha Airport Station. You can also load the card with cash at a bus. Ask the driver to charge your card. I will spend 2000 yen round trip to southern Okinawa from Naha. There is also a lot to do near walking distance in Naha city so my transportation cost averaged around 1000 yen per day. Tokyo was 500 yen per day with a 72 hour pass.\n\nThe bus frequency is 10 \u2013 45 minutes. Some buses stop service at 8:00p.m. Sometimes I wait at a bus stop with google maps saying bus is arriving \u201cnow\u201d I see no bus and then my phone updates to the next bus in \u201c45 minutes\u201d or even worst my phone updates there is no more bus service that day. The next bus is 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. I walk to another bus stop closer to my destination and wait for another bus. Once the same thing happened to the second bus stop so I walked quite a bit more. I wasn\u2019t worried about safety because the weather was nice and the rain was short and mild. The bus cost is by distance so I remember my bus ride from Ojima Island to Naha city took 1 hour and cost around 850 yen.\n\nSeasonality: I think I was in off season. I check the Hip Hop Bus Tour now and is available every day. When I booked in January my tour was only available 2 days per week. On the tour day the 40 capacity bus had 15 people.\n\nWeather: I wore a light puffer jacket and pants. Sometimes a sweater or just t-shirt is enough. I always carried an umbrella. The rain comes unpredictably. The sky can be blue and sunny and suddenly rain lightly for 30 minutes to 3 hours. It rained 3 out of 8 days. \u00a0Temperature was 19C - 13C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConclusion: Okinawa felt like another country so was definitely worth the extra flights between Osaka and Taipei. The safety and hospitality felt same as mainland Japan. \u00a0The food cost is same or lower than Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka.

        "selftext": "8 Day Okinawa Trip Report\n\nJanuary 4 2025 \u2013 January 12 2025\n\nContext: I am flying in from Osaka, Japan and flew out to Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nReason of this trip report: There wasn\u2019t much info on Okinawa when I was researching. I really enjoyed Okinawa and the whole time the places occupancy rate were under 25% of capacity. The locals are kind and heavily rely on tourism. More tourist should consider Okinawa because there is a lot to offer and is under capacity.\n\nPlan: I was going to stay in Naha city for the convenience, being close to airport and more Airbnb options. I was going to explore more of south mainland Okinawa because its more accessible with bus. I was going to take a tour bus to view some highlights of northern Okinawa. I was going to skip the islands and very north of Okinawa because I didn\u2019t want to drive and there is already a lot to see in 8 days. I feel I can always go back to Okinawa so I don\u2019t need to see the entirety the first time.\n\nJanuary 4^(th)\n\nFlew in to Naha Airport at 5p.m. I checked in my Airbnb at 6:30p.m\n\nNaha Kokusai Dori Shopping Street: Very lively markets. There is more public music from restaurants. There are singers busking. There are a lot of markets and busy streets connected together. You can walk this area for a long time. I ate at a bar and oddly I was charged additional 300 yen table fee. First time hearing this fee. I googled it later and it\u2019s a thing here for locals too. I never saw the table fee at restaurants in Okinawa.\n\nJanuary 5^(th)\n\nOkinawa craft industry promotion center: Interesting concept. Part museum displaying crafts made in Okinawa. Part store. Part workshops area for weaving fabric and other crafts. Part private studios where artisans can make product out of. There is beautiful greenery in this area too. Free\n\n\u00a0\n\nJapanese navel headquarters visitors center: Alot of photos and video on the history of the Okinawa battle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFormer Japanese navy underground headquarters: 600Yen. Large tunnel network which some was restored for public to see.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa outlet mall ashibinaa: Odd to see a mix of semi luxury shopping with kids activities you would see at a carnival. Bouncy castles, train rides, small spinning amusement park rides.\n\nIias Okinawa Toyosaki. Has the generic stuff plus a cat caf\u00e9, connected to an aquarium, food court and many children\u2019s activities. In mall playgrounds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChura-san Beach: Nice little beach. I left early because it started to rain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 6^(th)\n\nOkinawa Hip Hop Bus Tour through Klook. It runs 2 days a week. On that day there were 13 Japanese tourist and 2 foreign tourist. Total 15 people went and the bus can hold 40. Tour guide was friendly and spoke Japanese and English for us 2 foreigners.\n\nVery fast and fun. There is no way I could reach half those places in a day with public bus.\n\nThe weather wasn\u2019t good so we skipped glass boat at kariyushi beach.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNeopark: It kind of old and past it\u2019s prime but I liked the novelty.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa churaumi aquarium: I like this aquarium because it showed the big tank with whale shark and mantas. There wasn\u2019t \u201cfiller\u201d exhibits with goldfish and other small creatures which I already seen a lot of. There were few big exhibits with educational exhibits and logistic exhibits on how they capture and move the whale.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBise-fukugi tree road. There was a lot there to see. There was a scooter rental and a beach. I was only there for 30 minutes so I missed a lot of it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYachimun no sato is a pottery place. There is a huge outdoor kiln that fires 2 times a year. There were a lot of pottery stores there and workshop. The prices were 2000-3000 yen for a plate or cup but its handmade.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmerican Village. Many large stores and buildings in an American style. There is lots of LEDS and there again things little kids would like. Such as large character statues.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Japanese are on time to get back to the tour bus. One Japanese ran and was panting when coming back to the tour bus when 3 minutes late, apologizing and bowing when entering back into the bus. The bus driver greets you every time you enter and exit the bus.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 7^(th)\n\nKarate museum. Turns out its a dojo and the owner lives upstairs in the building. There are no drop ins for the museum inside. No one answered the door when I range the bell.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural archaeological center. There was 2 exhibition rooms. About the origins of Okinawa. There wasn\u2019t much and little was translated into English. Free.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFarmers market yonabaru agarihama market: I thought it was a farmers market like said in google maps buts it\u2019s more of a grocery store. There they sold grain by the kg. There was a machine and attendant there ready to package your grain.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMarine plaza agarihama: A strip mall with large department stores. There was a daiso there which many items were 120yen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 8^(th)\n\nmanga souko urasoe: second hand store 2 floors. Lots of clothes, instruments, DVDs, video games.\n\n\u00a0\n\nmakeman urasoe main branch. Very large department store.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMinatogawa stateside town: The concept is each street is a U.S. state. There are many units that are cafes, retail, tattoo shop, craft workshop. There wasn\u2019t much going on. Many stores are closed and the prices are high.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural library: Library is floor 2-4. Tourist info center was in same building. Naha bus terminal was also here. I read short book about Japanese moving to Brazil after WW2 because at the same time Brazil abolish slavery so cheap labor was needed in the coffee plantations.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMatsuyama park: There was a tribute to a karate guy there. It was odd that the men\u2019s and women public washrooms entrances facing infront each other. Men can see straight into the women bathroom and vice versa.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 9\n\nOkinawa world: Kinda touristy. The underground cave was nice. Staff took a free picture when we entered. When we exited we scanned the QR code and they printed a free small black and white photo. They offered an already printed and made color photo for 1000 yen. I declined and they threw the photo out. There was a snake show, fruit garden, many shops, glass demonstration.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI walked past a lot of sugar cane farms to\n\n\u00a0\n\nOjima island: Very small. I could walk it in 20 minutes. Nice views and restaurant. There were families teaching their toddler how to fish and kids baseball game happening there. There was sign saying glass bottom boat but most stores were closed when I was there at 7p.m.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 10^(th)\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa prefectural peace memorial museum: Very large, clean and comprehensive of the battle of Okinawa. Has testimonials, videos, artifacts, human scale replicas of stores, markets in the time after ww2. There was also an observatory tower.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeace memorial park. There was also an outdoor touchscreen to help you find where each person was located.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOkinawa Peace hall. A large Budda, paintings, garden and butterfly green house. All for 300 yen. I never went to see butterflies because its often $15+ in North America.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the memorials much at the south end because it started raining more and my umbrella broke.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHimeyuri cenotaph: Beautiful garden with sad story. I bought flowers for 300 yen.\n\nHimeyuri peace museum: very sad. The testimonials are very detail and immersive. I left early\n\nbecause I didn\u2019t want to cry so much.\n\nRyukyu glass village: There were demonstrations, stores, restaurants workshops. Very large.\n\nJanuary 11^(th)\n\nI walked to Naha bus terminal to get a refund on my okica card. There was a 200 yen fee. I got back around 1300 yen. Today and tomorrow I stop using buses and only monorail which I can pay with pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShurijo castle: I saw a lot of castles in mainland Japan so I didn\u2019t pay the 400 yen to enter. I walked through the outer castle area towards\u2026\n\nKinjo Stone road: The stone road was beside residential area. It must be tiresome to live on that rocky road. I found a marble on this road and kept it as souvenir.\n\nTamauden: I went in for 300 yen. There wasn\u2019t much to see but it wasn\u2019t expensive. Tamauden is a tomb of a royal family. There is also a beautiful garden here. There is a road with a row of old lush trees on each side. It is a nice picture spot that is empty a few minutes at a time.\n\nShuri Ryusen: Google maps said tourist attraction but its really a store on main level, coral painting t-shirts on 2^(nd)\u00a0level. There was so many tables on second floor, the capacity was 40 people but I was the only one there.\n\nOkinawa prefectural museum and art museum: The museum was 450 yen and art was 400 yen. I only saw the permanent exhibits. The museum was ok, pretty large and show a good summary of Okinawa. The history, artifacts, nature. The art was small. There were very few exhibits. 3 rooms. 1 media, 1 sculpture, 1 paintings.\n\nI walked through San-a-naha main place. Its a big mall with the usual.\n\nJanuary 12^(th)\n\nWoke up at 4am. Had breakfast from 7-11. Walk to nearest monorail and went straight to Naha airport via pasmo.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFood: It was my first time seeing Okinawa onigiri with egg and spam and was delicious. There are so many local restaurants. I only ate at a few restaurants and ordered there everyday. Once I find spots I like, I eat there the whole trip.\n\nI ate \u70c8\u706b\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u6696\u66ae \u90a3\u8987\u958b\u5357\u5e97 often. The owner has high standards and was patient in explaining to me how to order and pick noodle options. Owner remade my fried rice because an apprentice made a small mistake. Owner remade it himself. I didn\u2019t complain or ask for it to be remade. 450 yen fried rice. 850 yen ramen.\n\nI ate breakfast at Norichan 550 yen for the breakfast combo. I was really impressed with the discipline of this restaurant. The staff huddled in a circle. Someone gave instructions and staff enthusiastically said \u201chai!\u201d and starting working with intention.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTransportation:\n\nThe monorail coverage is short and a bit more expensive than Tokyo. 2-3 stops can be 300 yen. The monorail takes pasmo, Suica and Okica. The buses only use Okica card which you can buy at any monorail station. Including Naha Airport Station. You can also load the card with cash at a bus. Ask the driver to charge your card. I will spend 2000 yen round trip to southern Okinawa from Naha. There is also a lot to do near walking distance in Naha city so my transportation cost averaged around 1000 yen per day. Tokyo was 500 yen per day with a 72 hour pass.\n\nThe bus frequency is 10 \u2013 45 minutes. Some buses stop service at 8:00p.m. Sometimes I wait at a bus stop with google maps saying bus is arriving \u201cnow\u201d I see no bus and then my phone updates to the next bus in \u201c45 minutes\u201d or even worst my phone updates there is no more bus service that day. The next bus is 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. I walk to another bus stop closer to my destination and wait for another bus. Once the same thing happened to the second bus stop so I walked quite a bit more. I wasn\u2019t worried about safety because the weather was nice and the rain was short and mild. The bus cost is by distance so I remember my bus ride from Ojima Island to Naha city took 1 hour and cost around 850 yen.\n\nSeasonality: I think I was in off season. I check the Hip Hop Bus Tour now and is available every day. When I booked in January my tour was only available 2 days per week. On the tour day the 40 capacity bus had 15 people.\n\nWeather: I wore a light puffer jacket and pants. Sometimes a sweater or just t-shirt is enough. I always carried an umbrella. The rain comes unpredictably. The sky can be blue and sunny and suddenly rain lightly for 30 minutes to 3 hours. It rained 3 out of 8 days. \u00a0Temperature was 19C - 13C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConclusion: Okinawa felt like another country so was definitely worth the extra flights between Osaka and Taipei. The safety and hospitality felt same as mainland Japan. \u00a0The food cost is same or lower than Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka. My transportation cost was on average higher 500 yen per day in Okinawa than Tokyo. I found It odd that I was in off-season because the weather was so nice. I definitely want to go back in the future and explore the islands and northern Okinawa.\n\nSpending\n\n11980 yen Osaka to Okinawa plane ticket\n\n12496 yen Okinawa to Taipei plane ticket\n\n37489 yen Airbnb. Small apartment with private kitchen and bathroom.\n\n7745 yen \u00a0Buses and monorail. I walked a lot.\n\n26088 yen Eating out. I didn't cook at all.\n\n3000 shopping\n\n7849 yen Okinawa Hip Hop Bus Day Tour\n\n4,050 yen museum and exhibits.\n\nTotal: 110,697 yen or $745.64 USD",

        "selftext": "Hey, I'm going to Malaysia at the end of September for three weeks and am trying to make an itinerary. I'm a young solo budget traveler without a driver's license mostly looking forward to the nature and adventure that can be experienced.\n\nI was planning to go to Cameron Highlands but I read that some people found it underwhelming. I'd prefer to not spend money on a tour over there since I'd like to join tours for Taman Negara, the Kinabatanang river and maybe a national park on Borneo. I'd like to spend my money for those. Since I also don't have a driver's license and it will be rainy season I'm wondering if it'd even be worth it going there.\n\nRight now I'm thinking of spending two days in Tanah Rata, renting an (electric) bicycle over there to go where i can and go on some hikes. This won't be during a weekend.\n\nAlternatively I would go to Penang and spend about three days there, was first planning on skipping it because of the rain.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from people who have visited Cameron Highlands or who been in Malaysia (west-coast) in September/October.

Currently, we\u2019re planning for a week in Athens and Rome with a day trip to Florence. I\u2019ll be free from Wednesday to Sunday and fly out of Istanbul, so i\u2019m thinking of at least doing the weekend there. However, I\u2019m thinking of checking out at least one more city/area before I fly back to Istanbul. So realistically, I could travel in on Wednesday, and fly to Istanbul Saturday morning. \n\nI\u2019m currently prioritizing meeting other tourists through hostels since I enjoy hanging with other people, as well as potentially a lady friend (but no expectations, just want to enjoy my time). In terms of things to do, nightlife (I listen to EDM), food, local markets, a unique culture, walkable areas, and scenic/picturesque views would be at the top of my list. I don\u2019t care as much for history since I\u2019ll already be seeing a lot. Budget is not the biggest deal since I want to make the most of it, but I\u2019m planning to stay in a hostel anyway to meet people (will do a private room). \n\nAlthough I\u2019ve read good things about Spain and Portugal, it is a bit further and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite worth the extra flight just for a day or two. I\u2019ve been to Belgium and Amsterdam and thought both were pretty great. Safety wise, I\u2019m from SF and am probably okay walking around the Tenderloin at night but not the biggest fan, and also there\u2019s no petty crime going on there, which I don\u2019t want to have to worry about especially while intoxicated. The places I\u2019m currently considering though are:\n\nBologna and Venice - for the canals and good food but sounds overly touristy in Venice. \n\nNaples/Pompeii/Amalfi coast - Pompeii ruins sound pretty cool, and maybe the coast during the day, and go out in Naples at night but not sure how rough it is these days.\n\nMilan - haven\u2019t done too much research honestly but seems less unique\n\nMadrid or Barcelona - might be easier to save for a Spain/Ibiza trip next year but both sound super fun honestly, though I would be pushing the amount I could do. \n\nBudapest or Prague - pretty out of the way but sounds like the solo travel and nightlife scene is top tier. \n\nI haven\u2019t looked much into Balkan cities but I\u2019m not as inclined to go to that area. \n\nWhich of these cities, or any others, have other solo travelers and possibly a weekday nightlife? It would also be fun to just tag along with other travelers. Also, I would love any good hostel recommendations in any of these cities. I\u2019m east asian looking if that matters. Thanks in advance!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi all, I\u2019m a 24 year old M looking to take a 3ish week trip in April to somewhere warm where I could combine a city holiday and beach holiday. I\u2019ve traveled solo before but only done short trips in Europe. I\u2019m flying from HEL and my budget is around 3000\u20ac, flights included. \n\nI love nature, history and sports. I\u2019m not that big of a foodie and I don\u2019t like to eat alone, so fuel has been merely a fuel for me so far but I\u2019m willing to expand my views on that. \n\nIve been thinking about two separate ares I\u2019d like to go to. First Mexico City and Cancun area. I\u2019ve heard great thing about CDMX and I figured it would be a waste not to see it when travelling to Mexico. I\u2019d watch football, go to the museums, see some parks and forests and just enjoy what the city has to offer. I speak Spanish on a decent level so it would be of use.\n\nFrom there I\u2019d fly to Cancun, the beaches are supposed to be phenomenal and better than in the other area I\u2019ve thought about. I\u2019d enjoy the weather and beach life there, visit Bacalar and Chacchoben, Valladolid, Isla Mujeres, and very much would love to see the forests around there. Then I\u2019d fly back to CDMX and fly back to HEL. I\u2019d have a layover in DFW that could be a bit of a hassle, or so I\u2019ve been told. \n\nThe second area is SEA. I\u2019d fly to Singapore and spend some time there, then I\u2019d go to Kuala Lumpur. From there I\u2019d go to Langkawi and chill and enjoy the beaches there. I could also catch a ferry to Koh Lipe to see Thailand as well. In these parts I\u2019d love to see the nature, and relax. \n\nSo my conclusions are: in Mexico I could see CDMX that I\u2019ve heard so much good about, watch football live, see the beautiful beaches, practise my Spanish and see the ruins. But it would probably be a more challenging first long solo trip, more expensive and a bit more unsafe than in SEA. I probably couldn\u2019t relax as much. Travelling there would be more work too.\n\nTo Singapore I could fly straight from HEL, and on that trip see potentially 2 other countries as well in Malaysia and Thailand, and two major Asian metropolies in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. It would be more safe and cheaper there. The beaches supposedly aren\u2019t as good as in Quintana Roo in Cancun area, and maybe the weather as well,  in Langkawi it could maybe get pretty wet where I\u2019d probably spend most of my time in. But Koh Lipe also interests me, it looks pretty there. \n\nThese are my thoughts, the plans are on a quite basic level so that\u2019s why I\u2019m very open to critique, and any kind of advice and recommendations. I know there\u2019s a not much time until around mid April when I\u2019d go, so I have that in mind. Where should I go, Mexico, SEA, some place else? \n\nThanks :) ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the people I\u2019ve met on the road, those brief, magical encounters that somehow leave a lasting impact. Solo travel can be really lonely, but it\u2019s also given me some of the most interesting connections of my life, even if they were only for a moment.\n\nThere was the student on a 4-month language exchange, struggling with Mandarin but full of determination. We laughed over mispronunciations and swapped horrible dating stories in our respective home countries. Then there was the hydroponics engineer and a conversation about sustainability that lasted hours. I\u2019ll never forget the man who worked on the rescue boat of the Norway\u2019s equivalent of Deepwater Horizon, his stories were equal parts heartbreaking and awe-inspiring. And once, I met someone who grew up in a temple in Kyoto, sharing lessons on mindfulness that I still carry with me.\n\nI\u2019ve found myself reminiscing about these encounters, wondering where those people are now. Are they still traveling? Did they make it to that next destination they were so excited about? It\u2019s a strange bittersweet feeling, that these people, who once felt so close, are now strangers again. But at the same time, I\u2019m grateful for those moments. They taught me that connection doesn\u2019t have to be permanent to be meaningful.\n\nMay our travels be filled with connection, adventure, and just the right amount of bittersweet nostalgia.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI\u2019m super excited (and a little nervous) because I\u2019ll be traveling solo for the first time to Argentina! \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 I\u2019ll be in Buenos Aires for the first week of April, hanging out with some colleagues, and then from April 6-14, I\u2019ll be in Patagonia\u2014mostly in El Chalt\u00e9n\u2014hiking and hopefully meeting some cool people along the way.\n\nI fly back to Barcelona on April 20 and plan to spend April 17-20 in Buenos Aires. But from April 14-17, I still need to figure out where to go! My original plan was Puerto Madryn for the wildlife, but I just realized it\u2019s gonna be way too expensive, and I\u2019m trying to keep costs down. I also looked into Bariloche, but it seems even pricier than Patagonia \ud83d\ude02. So now I\u2019m considering Mendoza, Salta, or C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nWould love any recommendations on where to go for those few days! I\u2019m 26M, originally from Mumbai but have been living in Barcelona for the past four years. Open to budget-friendly adventures, meeting new people, and soaking in as much of Argentina as possible. Thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude0a",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\nFirst time solo traveling in a long time, going to Vietnam and then Taiwan. Would love critique on Vietnam portion, and any advice...\n\nNote that I am gone for total 4.5 weeks and want to make sure I am not rushing around. I like traveling slow, generally. Walking around, exploring, taking photos, eating food.\n\nDay 1-4 (Tues-Fri): Arrive in Hanoi after 22 hrs of travel from NYC, stay in Hanoi 3 nights. Note that I.. am terrible at jet lag. Booked a food tour for the Wednesday. I guess, explore and see sights?\n\nDay 4-7 (Fri-Mon): Take a bus to Mai Chau for the weekend for Equation festival (which will be fun, and I assume exhausting). Hopefully time to bike around and explore as well. Likely pretty social too.\n\nDay 7-10 (Mon-Thurs): Ninh Binh area, staying in Tam Coc, chill and explore.\n\nDay 10-13 (Thurs-Sun): Back to Hanoi via bus or train, figure I will go try and check out some of the nightlife spots (Savage, Unmute), hopefully will have met some folks at the festival to reconnect with. Here is one area where I'm like.. should I stay an extra day in Ninh Binh and come friday? Should I bother with a trip to Ha Long Bay or something??\n\nDay 13-15 (Sun-Tues): Fly from Hanoi to Hue in the afternoon of Sunday, spend Monday exploring Hue\n\nDay 15-17 (Tues-Thurs): Early tues, stay in either Da Nang or Hoi An (which??) get some beach time, etc - fly to Taipei on Thursday morning.\n\nMy big questions I guess are would you add a day to either Hue or Ninh Binh and take one from my return to Hanoi? Should I try and squeeze in a day trip somewhere instead of going back to Hanoi? I'm trying to also account for my travel recovery, jet lag, and festival recovery. And any thoughts around the Hue/Da Nang/Hoi An mix and where to stay? (Or even... stay an extra day in Mai Chau after the festival to explore before going to Ninh Binh!??)\n\n(Also noting that I am also saving energy for time in Taiwan! And also this will be my first solo trip in a minute, and first time back in Asia in a decade - first time in either country ever)",

        "selftext": "I am going to be in Spain in March 2026 for classes. My plan is to fly into Istanbul in late December and then travel east to west (Turkey, Greece and Italy) until I end up in Spain at the beginning of March. I have traveled solo in Costa Rica, Ecuador and Ireland for a few months at a time so I'm not a complete beginner but definitely not as experienced as some. \n\n**What I'm looking to experience:** Food, ancient sites and religious locations. I love hiking and want to experience the natural beauty as much as possible. I'm not into drinking/partying when alone so I'm not concerned with finding clubs or bars. \n\n**My concerns:** \n\n* I know these three countries are big on seasonal tourism. I'm worried everything is going to be shut down (i.e. hostels, tours) or at least super hard to come by. \n* Overextending myself is a big concern. Three countries in two months might involve an excessive amount of travel time especially since I would prefer to avoid planes where possible (environmental concerns not a nervous flyer!). \n\nIf you were in my shoes how would you divide up the time? I am flexible to traveling to different locations (for example I've heard Croatia is incredible) since my only hard deadline is getting to Spain by March. Also if you have any advice on traveling for someone who knows the basics but has only been to \"easy\" destinations I would truly appreciate it! \n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi all, I (25M) am planning to visit India in May for the first time for my grad trip. I am focusing mainly on the Golden Triangle + Rajasthan (although I know people will suggest the Himalayan regions or South India).  I have experience travelling solo in the US, via flights and overnight sleeper buses.\n\nI know that May isn't really an ideal time, but I don't think I will be free in the October to March period.  I am used to the tropical climate (from Southeast Asia), so I think I may be slightly more acclimatised to the temperature? Or should I rethink this trip entirely?\n\nLooking to get some feedback on my tentative itinerary, as listed below:\n\n\\---\n\n**Day 1 (Delhi):**\n\n* Arrival in India at \\~1200\n* South Delhi: Qutub Minar + Lotus Temple\n\n**Day 2 (Delhi):**\n\n*  Humayun\u2019s Tomb + Safdarjung Tomb + Lodhi Gardens\n* Overnight sleeper train/bus to Amritsar\n\n**Day 3 (Amritsar):**\n\n*  Partition Museum\n* Attari-Wagah Border\n\n**Day 4 (Amritsar):**\n\n* Heritage Walking tour\n* Jallianwala Bagh\n* Central Sikh Museum + Golden Temple\n* Overnight sleeper train/bus to Delhi\n\n**Day 5 (Delhi):**\n\n*  Old Delhi: Red Fort + Jama Masjid + Chandi Chowk Market \n* Rajghat Memorial\n\n**Day 6 (Delhi):**\n\n*  New Delhi: Rashtrapati Bhavan (tour) + India Gate\n* National Museum\n* Agrasen ki Baoli\n* Connaught Place\n\n**Day 7 (Agra):**\n\n* Morning train (Gatimann Express) to Agra\n*  Agra Fort + Tomb of I'tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah + Mehtab Bagh\n\n**Day 8 (Agra):**\n\n* Taj Mahal at sunrise\n* Private driver to Sawai Madhopur, with stops at Akbar's Tomb + Fatehpur Sikri + Abhaneri Chand Baori\n\n**Day 9 (Sawai Madhopur):**\n\n* Ranthambore National Park: 1 day safari + 1 evening safari\n\n**Day 10 (Jaipur):**\n\n* Morning bus to Jaipur\n* City Palace\n* Jantar Mantar\n* Hawa Mahal\n\n**Day 11 (Jaipur):**\n\n* Amber Fort\n* Jaigarh Fort\n* Jal Mahal (Man Sagar Lake) \n* Gaitor Ki Chhatriyan\n* Nahargarh Fort (sunset)\n\n**Day 12 (Jaipur):**\n\n* Patrika Gate\n* Albert Hall Museum\n* Galta Ji\n* Overnight sleeper bus to Udaipur\n\n**Day 13 (Udaipur):**\n\n* Jagdish Mandir\n* City Palace\n* Jag Mandir (Lake Pichola boat ride)\n* Explore Ghats (Rameshwar ghat, Ambrai Ghat)\n* Bagore ki Haveli (evening show)\n\n**Day 14 (Udaipur):**\n\n* Bahubali hills\n* Monsoon Palace\n* Fatehsagar\n\n**Day 15 (Udaipur):**\n\n* Private driver to Kumbhalgarh Fort + Ranakpur Temple\n* To Jodhpur\n\n**Day 16 (Jodhpur):**\n\n* Mehrangarh Fort\n* Jaswant Thada\n* Blue City\n\n**Day 17 (Jodhpur):**\n\n* Toorji Ka Jhalra Bavdi\n* Ghanta Ghar\n* Afternoon flight to Mumbai\n* ???\n\n**Day 18 (Mumbai):**\n\n* Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya Museum\n* Oval Maidan\n* Gateway Of India Mumbai + Taj Mahal Palace\n* Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus\n* Overnight train to Aurangabad\n\n**Day 19 (Aurangabad):**\n\n* Ellora Caves\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara\n\n**Day 20 (Aurangabad):**\n\n* Ajanta Caves\n* Overnight bus back to Mumbai\n\n**Day 21 (Mumbai)**\n\n* Haji Ali Dargah\u00a0\n* Dhobi Ghat\n* Colaba Market\n* Mani Bhavan Gandhi Museum\n* Marine Drive\n* Late night departure flight (2300+)\n\n\\---\n\nLet me know what you think; I'll love to hear any and all suggestions.

        "selftext": "Some context, I'm a university student living in the UK. I've only ever been out of the country twice, once in 2022 to see my girlfriend in South Korea, and again to Poland just a couple months ago.\n\nWhen I went to SK, it was for a month through August, so I could spend as much time with her as possible. When I was ready to leave, we decided to end the relationship as we both had things to do and didn't want long- distance relationships.\n\nAnyway, over the past couple years, I've come to realise that I've haven't been as happy since that holiday, and after going Poland I've realised that I want to travel again, so I've been thinking about going to South Korea again because it is a lovely place. But I'm not confident in going based on how people usually go on holidays.\n\nFrom what I can tell, people usually go on holidays for a week, maybe 2. Go with multiple people and have all sorts of plans in place. But I've been thinking of going for 2, maybe 3 weeks. I don't planing on spending time with certain people this time, so I'll mostly be alone. I've also learnt a lot more Korean so I want to sort of test myself. I don't know, I want to go but I'm not sure if it's a normal thing to really do.\n\ntl;dr Is it fine to go to South Korea for maybe 3 weeks alone to find out how to be happy again?",

I started when I was 18 and I have like a small dozens of solo trips, from 4 days to 1 month.\n\nI will have a 3weeks trip in China in May, and I'm hesitating to buy a \"vlog camera\" to document my journey. In fact, I have only few memories from my first trips, and when I look at pictures I took, this feels really impersonal : either monuments pictures, or bad selfies.\n\nI am wondering if recording some days of my trip would help the future me to remember it more in details.\n\nAny thoughts about vlogging, is it weird at first to talk alone to a camera in front of a crowded street ? Do we get used to it ? (for personnal use only I precise)\n\nDo you relate about forgetting your trips, and if yes, how do you fix that issue ?\n\nThanks by advance :\\^)",

        "selftext": "Apologies for the terrible pun on Backstreet Boy\u2019s Backstreet\u2019s Back. For context, \u201cbaksheesh\u201d is the Egyptian word for tip (or bribe).\n\nSpent my time in Luxor and feel like it\u2019s worth offering some views, given how polarised views here are on Egypt in general.\n\nFor context - I am a straight man, and have a beard / enough height and size that I don\u2019t look like an easy mark, but I certainly don\u2019t pass as Egyptian. I know some basic Arabic, but pronouncing things like \u201cSabaH al-khayr\u201d properly can help ingratiate with Arabic speakers (my level isn\u2019t much beyond that).\n\n* As everyone considering a trip to Egypt knows, the history is amazing. And every sight I went to in and around Luxor was incredible.\n\n* The process for the sights themselves isn\u2019t bad - you go to ticket counters nearby or at the sights, can pay in cash, and there was far less of pushy vendors inside the sights themselves, or trying to sell donkey/horse rides, vs Petra as a recent and similar-ish point of comparison.\n\n * There are people around who, surprisingly, seem very reasonable in their prices. I walked the length of the corniche and was looking to either take a sunset felucca or just cross back to my hotel on the other side of the Nile. A bloke at the side of the corniche offered me a motorboat, with his \u201ccousin\u201d running a felucca etc.. but ultimately paid \u20ac10 for an hour on a felucca at sunset, and the crossing (and also a cup of tea, but watching the cup get rinsed in the Nile took that one off the agenda).\n\n* Unfortunately, there is also an absolute \u201ctourist = bottomless money pit\u201d mentality. I stood outside my hotel one morning waiting for a shared group tour that was late to arrive and had multiple taxi drivers either sidle up or shout out the window, kids coming up asking for money etc. There was even a taxi driver ranting about \u201cwhy do tourists always try and find things cheaply?\u201d when I hadn\u2019t even really bothered to engage in discussing what I was looking for (and when I did go to a couple of sights solo with a taxi driver, the price worked out about the same as a private tour, particularly after the good old shifting sands of what was agreed vs demanded).\n\n* I only really saw the genuine friendliness of people in the Egyptologist guides and their passion for the country, or when a deal had been agreed with someone. The felucca drivers were genuinely lovely, but after we\u2019d agreed a deal. Taxi drivers (like everyone) were always willing to do more with you and came across as friendly, but there was always a cranking up of the price, a friend / family member who could do X or Y. Even the (great) guides I had as part of both group and private tours would be upselling me with other trips the company offered. All in all, perfectly manageable for me but could be frustrating and I can see how people not used to the salesmanship all the time would find it tough. The hotel I stayed at was reviewed multiple times as \u201clike a second family by many\u201d. It was certainly run by a family, but the customer service felt lacking - unless there was backsheesh.\n\n* Everyone wants backsheesh all the time. For everything. Mostly I found this amusing more than annoying. Day one mistake of only having 100 EGP notes made my airport toilet trip the most expensive of my life. But it would also get frustrating where, for example in the tomb of the workers despite having a guide, a security guard took it on himself to shout out what things were from the other side of the (small) tomb then demand backsheesh. If you make the mistake of opening your wallet, they\u2019ll want either more or the backsheesh in USD / EUR etc. The funniest was a man in Habu temple pointing towards the colourful ceiling and thinking that should earn backsheesh. But it can be frustrating as most things are handled in cash, and I\u2019d often either not have enough to buy eg water without breaking bigger notes (shop owners didn\u2019t always carry enough change), or someone would get annoyed the backsheesh wasn\u2019t high enough.\n\nOverall, the history is fantastic. There are good people in Egypt. And at least as a thick-shinned man you absolutely can do the south (I\u2019ve not been to Cairo so won\u2019t speak on it) solo, whether that\u2019s using taxi drivers to go round sights; shared group tours; or private groups. But, it can be draining. Let alone from the heat. \n\nI saw lots of women in groups or couples who weren\u2019t particularly covered up - during Ramadan - and didn\u2019t observe them getting hassled. But I can\u2019t claim to know what they experienced; just to note they were around. The solo travellers I met on trips who were women (one from Japan, one from Chile, one Dutch) all noted they were enjoying their time, despite frustrations from merchants etc. They were all mostly doing shared group tours in Luxor.\n\nAll that to say - I wouldn\u2019t write it off, as the history is *that* good. And at least down south, it\u2019s not as awful as many commenters have made it out to be (note - as a man). However, you need to have a thick skin, to know how to handle pushy merchants / developing countries and expect it to be full on. Egypt is chaos. Sometimes good chaos, sometimes draining.",

I have already been to Singapor and travelled solo around Europe and with my partner around the world for the background. I will be flying in Kuala Lumpur and leave from there 2 weeks later.

I am not a party person. \n\nI am interested in visiting a bit of Malaysia, I have already been to beautiful tea plantations so will skip the Cameron highlands (as it also seems to be very disneyfied). So for the first part of my trip I am considering doing 4 nights in Kuala Lumpur, 2 nights in Ipoh and 4 nights in Penang. I have then 6 nights left. My current options are: \n\n\\- Staying in Malaysia: going to Teman Negara and then Langkawi. Cons: it will be rainy season in Langkawi and I am not really sure Langkawi is my vibe, I am more of a person enjoying quiet beach/islands without too much big hotel complexes, which seems to be a feature for the various islands of Malaysia or its beaches. \n\n\\- Going to Medan in North Sumatra (cheap flights from Malaysia) and go for a trek, have a look at Medan, maybe lake Toba. Con: I might want to keep this for an other trip in Indonesia with my partner. \n\n\\- Going to Bangkok and exploring the city + Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya. I have never been to Thailand. Con: rainy season so not sure how it is to visit Ayutthaya at that time of the year? Also my trip might lack of time in the nature .\n\n  \n\\- Going to Lombok: quieter than Bali, beautiful nature, dry season, might be nice to just relax at the end of my trip. Con: harder to move around (need to use grab) and might feels a bit disjoncted to the rest of my trip and not sure that's the best introduction to Indonesia (love the idea of vistiting Indonesian islands but would love to pair it with visiting a city and as I said above, planning a month trip to Indonesia in the future with my partner). \n\nWhat do you think?

I have these in my mind - - El nido - Cebu - Boracay I do appreciate if anyone help me with more suggestions and with some more underrated places. Appreciate you help guys!\n\n  \nUpdate 1: So I've narrowed down my focus and areas. 1.EL Nido and Palawan I definitely want to explore. 2. Gotta choose between Boracay and Siargao. Here I'm looking for party vibes as a solo traveller, and had a quite 50-50 situation here. So looking for your recommendations here!",

        "selftext": "I (33M) will be going to Vietnam at the end of April, it will be my first solo travel.\n\nWill be arriving and leaving from Hanoi, so I would focus on the north.\n\nWas thinking about Hanoi, Ninh Ninh, Sapa for sure. Then not sure whether to do Halong (or Cat Ba) or take a flight to Da Nang for a couple days (to include some days at the beach).\n\nThe idea is both to visit and relax, and maybe do some guided tours to find some people there.\n\nWhat do you think? Any suggestions or advices? Also on how to split days (not sure yet whether they will be 10 or 13).\n\nThanks a lot ",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ll preface this by saying this is my second trip to Japan, I\u2019m not new to solo travel, and that I did a fair amount of research beforehand (both trips) about Japanese etiquette.  I also may look Japanese which may have contributed, at least in part, to further the misunderstanding. \n\nWhat happened - and I\u2019m simplifying - is that I used the \u201cwrong\u201d method of calculating payment.  When I presented the ticket, the driver looked very disgruntled, pointed at the back of the bus, and tried to communicate something to me in Japanese which unfortunately I didn\u2019t understand. Obviously I had done something wrong at that point, but given a whole bus load of people were waiting for me (I have social anxiety), I just focused on problem solving and trying to pay for the fare.  I tried asking how to pay in English (so that he would know I didn\u2019t understand him) and pointed at my IC/subway card hoping to communicate visually. It was the main form of payment in Kyoto, so I assumed it was. He seemed to agree, I used my card, and I turned to walk off the bus. Before I even took a step, he HIT ME on my arm, HARD.  I was aghast.  It wasn\u2019t a tap, or even a grab to make sure I didn\u2019t leave. It was a straight up painful smack on the inner bone right below my rotator cuff. I froze in that moment, probably looking more like an idiot - but it honestly continued to hurt for another 10 minutes after I left. \n\nAnyways, he ended up manually typing in the amount, I paid with my IC and double confirmed everything was OK before leaving. But mixed with feeling alienated and intense prangs of homesickness already (I don\u2019t usually feel homesick while solo traveling), this incident just left me in a bad state of mind.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be the uninformed, disrespectful tourist. I just don\u2019t think what I did warranted violence. \n\nThere are some things that I felt contributed to it being confusing already - why was there a ticket dispenser there when shouldn\u2019t be used? Every city has their own way of what is needed to pay for a fare/seat - when I did the Kumano Kodo, they used this ticketing system. Local buses in Kyoto don\u2019t even have the ticket dispenser. Also why didn\u2019t he just manually input the fare in the first place when he saw the ticket? \n\nI don\u2019t know what I need. I guess I need a rant. Maybe some level of understanding. Or just to know I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019ve been feeling painful loneliness and so out of place here, it\u2019s hard not to catastrophize what happened.  \n\nI\u2019m distracting myself now with a hike but would love to hear from others who may have had a similar experience or can help me expand my perspective a bit. Thanks so much for reading this far.\n\nEdit: \n\nThank you everyone for taking the time to respond! The comments really helped me get through the day.  I can\u2019t respond to every comment but I upvoted anyone who contributed positively (including similar experiences, philosophical musings on cultural aspects that may have caused this, general commiseration, etc). \n\nFor everyone else trying to explain how bus fares work, you can stop. I\u2019m not confused, and many of your assumptions are frankly incorrect and advice misguided.  The bus I was on was not using a flat fee single ride fare system. \n\nI can understand and empathize with the driver\u2019s frustration. What I do not understand is the violence and why so many people think it\u2019s justified.  I\u2019m starting to wonder if (hope that?) a lot of these troll comments are bots.. \n\nEdit2:\n\nI\u2019m going to try to write the complaint in Japanese (via google translate) to reduce the amount of barriers it takes to get this thing filed and to the right eyes. Sadly I don\u2019t have any Japanese speaking friends, but if anyone wants to volunteer to proofread it, it\u2019d be so helpful. Ping me if you\u2019d be down! Thanks in advance. ",

        "selftext": "32f from the UK, setting off in a month for a 5 month solo trip through Japan/Korea & S.E.A\nPreviously have only done 3-4 day solo trips, longest 1 week travel solo before.\n\nI\u2019m really fortunate to have been granted a 6 month sabbatical from work, have saved a comfortable amount & have all my pre-travel admin done (vaccines/visas/money etc).\n\nI\u2019m not traditionally a huge planner, very much a \u2018rock up and figure it out\u2019 sort of person- mostly with great results although I do often find that a level of perfectionism comes out (I\u2019ll push myself to find \u2018the best cafe\u2019 \u2018the best food\u2019 \u2018the best spot to people-watch\u2019) that without someone else with me to temper I can often just end up burning myself out.\n\nI\u2019m obviously so excited but the closer the time comes I\u2019m getting a little overwhelmed, mainly by the Japan/Korea legs of the journey. Having never visited these parts of the world before, having no real reference points beyond recommendations from friends, the few things I\u2019ve read and travel guides etc, I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m not making the most of every single day. Feeling especially this way about these places in particular because they\u2019re mostly the big-city-based places and it seems like the restuarant/cafe/shop/activity options are endless.\n\nAlso slightly apprehensive about spending *so* much time in my own company (full disclosure I\u2019ve been single all my adult life, have lived alone with no issues before) but just don\u2019t want to get sick of my own brain! \n\nSorry this was quite rambling, I think I\u2019m just after some reassurance that winging it is okay within reason, and that a combination of alone time/making some friends along the way will not lead to me coming back hating myself!",

        "selftext": "Hi guys! I\u2019m flying out May 31st for my first longer than a month trip! I\u2019m spending June - August 1st in Europe and then August- November in SEA, and then going to end the year starting the Australian working holiday visa.\n\nI\u2019m estimating to have 12k (usd)  as a low budget for when I initially leave BUT I have my TEFL , so once I\u2019m in SEA i plan to use to that to tutor online or even work at a school because I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s easier over there with no Bachelors? Also going to be utilizing programs like world packers in SEA to save on the cost of living.\n\nSo my plan kind of goes as follows \n\nAll my lodging and transport within Europe is costing 1,500 -2,000 (using my tax refund so I don\u2019t count that in my 12-14k)\n\nI would fly from athens to Bangkok which is like an extra $400\n\nEurope for 2 months spending money : 3,000 which leaves me with anywhere between 9-11k and my goal from there is to try and bring in at least 1k a month doing TEFL online or just picking up trade work in general. (I don\u2019t want to be naive but I feel more confident that I\u2019ll be able to make even just minimal income in SEA) \n\nI will not let myself go into Australia blindly if I\u2019m finishing my trip with less than 5k in case of emergencies, and because the visa requires you to be able to support yourself financially. \n\nSo that would mean on a 12k budget I would have 7k to spend for 6ish months of travel if I brought no money in, 14k budget 9k in spending money IF i brought no money in, but I at least need to project making 3k in 5 months while in SEA. That spending money also includes my lodging in SEA, or flights in that area. \n\nI\u2019ve never done a long haul trip like this and I want to make sure I\u2019m being realistic before I get myself into a bad situation in a foreign country!! \n\nThank you \ud83d\udc93",

        "selftext": "How do you cope with the fact that you can't see the entire world?\n\n24F\nRealistically, even though i dedicate most of my free money to travel, I will never experience every country or part of the world. I want kids in the future which means I only have about 5 years left to travel freely, and even if I travel with them it won't be the same, I can't go self driving over dangerous countries for example and go camping solo for weeks on end with a toddler. Many places I can't go to now because its not safe as a woman or I can't get a visa or I don't have the skills(e.g. 4x4ing). Then I have to focus on my career for these next 5 years anyway with a month off a year to travel max between work, I'm doing a phd which means i cant just quit and go backpacking. I don't have any wealth and live paycheck to paycheck until I can just save up enough for a month or so travel again. Which is more than a lot of people have but it still feels suffocating. For context, I had a MH crisis a few years ago and the only thing that stopped me feeling 'at risk' was the hope of travel and seeing all these places. Now I've realised its all a fever dream.\n\nI know lots of people tick off every country and its possible but they never truly experience them, most just hop through for maybe a week or less for most places. See the top ten lonlely planet sites and eat something they saw on Instagram and then leave. I'll never be able to experience what it feel like to live everywhere in every culture and for some reason it really gets me down. I know its stupid but I get so hung up on it. I watch tv or social media and see people living the life of a rancher in the deep south US or a conservationist in Australia or a teacher in Japan etc and know I can never realistically live all those lives. And it hurts and occupies my mind a lot. Idk if this identity/quarter life crisis will ever end. I feel like the Sylvia Plath fig tree thing. It's torture. \n\nDoes anyone feel the same and how do you cope? Please don't be usual reddit condescending because I cant take it atm. I've tried therapy again but it hasn't helped.\n\nEdit this blew up more than i expected, thanks to all the people who provided advice and shared their similar feelings. To the people just coming by to call me priveliged, I know I'm priveliged to be able to see more than 90% of people can see, don't waste your heavy breathing and mechanical keyboard tapping on telling me. I would feel this way whether I lived in object poverty or whether i was an american with a rich daddy. Its about the existential feeling of not being able to experience everything and live different lives, not a desire to tick off countries as i dont really care about that. ",

Wanted to ask about some things in Lombok.\n\nFor context, I do not know how to ride a scooter, and I heard a scooter is the best way to go around the area. Some are saying that Grab/Gojek does not operate there, and some also say they do but only in certain areas. How can I go around the island if I don\u2019t have one? Is there a trusted company I can call for me to go around on a motorbike (with a driver).\n\nAlso, what would you guys recommend while I\u2019m there? Activities, places, beaches, etc. I\u2019ll be heading to Ubud first for two nights, take a ferry going to Lombok, stay there for three days, then go back to Bali for the rest of my trip.\n\nAny insights will be appreciated. Thanks! \n\nP.S. If you have any fun recos on what to do during my Birthday in Bali that would also help! Planning to stay in Uluwatu around that time.",

        "selftext": "**Tldr:**\n\n1. I can't take the flights that I booked to Europe and will almost certainly have to reschedule which will cost me at least $1,000.\n2. My 4 weeks in Europe is reduced to just a couple of weeks\n\nFor the past 6 months I've (26M) been thinking about quitting my job and taking a huge year long trip. First to Europe (coming from New Zealand) for about a month to see some friends I haven't seen since before the pandemic and explore the area on my own. Doing the usual solo travel, explore new cities, staying in hostels and partying with strangers. After that I would fly to Japan on a working holiday visa. I plan to stay here for almost 12 months. In Japan I'll be doing volunteering/home stays, immersing myself in the language as I've been studying it myself for a few years and just taking a break from my career as a software developer because I'm a little burnt out in my current role.\n\nThe one thing that set me back from going through with this was actually quitting my job. The job market isn't too hot right now and I kept putting off telling my boss I was quitting because I was worried that I would struggle to find another software job once I got back to New Zealand. I eventually booked my flights for the end of March to force myself to have to give my resignation notice 4 weeks before the flight dates.\n\nI did end up telling my boss I was quitting, but after about a week I had another chat with him and realised that I was actually eligible for a career break option, where I can take extended unpaid leave for up to 12 months. Perfect! I get the security and peace of mind while overseas that I will have a job when I come back. The problem is I now need to give a couple extra weeks notice which now goes beyond the date of my flight out to London :(\n\nFurthermore, with the stress of getting ready to quit my job and a few others things in life going on, I didn't submit my application for my working holiday visa early enough. I submitted it about 6 weeks before I would arrive in Japan but only about 2.5 weeks before my flight to Europe. They said in an email it takes 2 weeks so I was cutting it pretty close. They keep your passport the whole time so I need to back before I go to Europe. But when I handed in my application the person told me it could actually take up to 3 weeks because they're so busy right now. So now I might not even have my passport back before my original flight to London :(\n\nSo there's two reasons that I will have to reschedule my flight a couple weeks later. Which will cost me about $1,000 NZD or (about $600USD). It also means my 4 weeks in Europe will now only be 2 weeks, unless I reschedule my flight from London to Japan as well but then that's even more money :(\n\nI'm really frustrated that I've just wasted this money and lost time in Europe because I don't really have anyone to blame but myself. There's a lot of smaller details of stupid little things I did along the way that I didn't include in the story for the sake of brevity, but if I had simply been open with my boss a few weeks earlier about my plan to take this career break, then I would have been way less stressed and would have gotten the visa application sorted out way earlier. It was such a preventable mistake. I feel like I'm usually on top of these things but I somehow let this slip through and now my Europe trip is cut in half and I've taken a pretty significant hit to my wallet. It's hard to look forward to this trip now when I think about how I've already wasted so much money.\n\n**With that big wall of context done, I was wondering if anyone here had similar experiences:**\n\n* **Have you ever had to change very expensive flights last minute?**\n* **How did you get over the regret and frustration of making a dumb mistake?**\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThanks for your replies everyone! I understand that this complaint sounds very privileged and tone deaf. I wanted a place to vent my struggle with like minded people to make myself feel a little better. It's less about the money I've lost and more about just feeling dumb for making this mistake in the first place. I figured by venting and maybe hearing from others with similar stories that I'd feel a little better.",

        "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nDoes anyone have any backpack recommendations for women with chronic back pain (across my shoulder blades), I've had this for years and I do get a bad back if I am carrying huge weight for long periods of time - e.g. at festivals etc.\n\nI am thinking about doing a 3 week - 1 month solo travel trip to Bali in June and debating whether to get a large suitcase or use a backpack - I've seen loads of people recommend Osprey, but couldn't find many threads of people with backpain discussing which option is better. I dont think I would visit Gili islands and would be catching taxis mostly. I am thinking of purchasing the Osprey Daylite plus for my carry on bag to put my laptop in etc. I will have 25kg - 30kg of weight in the hold, so can easily put a suitcase in there. I know from going on hols pushing a medium sized case can be hard on uneven pavements /surfaces and means using lifts instead of carrying it down the stairs in the airport etc.\n\nAlso any recommendations of where to visit - I am into spirituality, wellness, I do like the occasional night out (Dnb), but nothing crazy. I would like to meet likeminded people so any places where I would meet late 20s - early 30's people with a similar vibe to me would be great.\n\nSo I think 7-10 days in Ubud (not sure if 10 days is too much). I would like to stay at Arya wellness retreat for women.\n\nI've heard mixed reviews about Canguu being really touristy and westernised - and some people mentioned visiting Ulwatu instead? Seminyak I'd like to visit. Maybe Sanur at the start of the trip as its close to the airport so I can crash out there after 1 day of flying from the UK.\n\nI'd like to visit Nusa Penida too.\n\nThank you",

        "selftext": "I'm planning a solo trip around Sikkim next month and while working on my itinerary, I\u2019ve realized that getting to North Sikkim as a foreigner seems a bit more complicated than I initially thought. From what I\u2019ve read, it looks like you need to form a group of only foreigne tourists to get permission to visit the north. \n\nSince I\u2019ll be traveling solo, I\u2019m wondering what my options are as a foreigner. Is it really that strict, and no mixed groups of local and foreign tourists are allowed when it comes to access to North Sikkim? Is it easy to find enough tourists to form such group? Are there any travel agencies or hostels that suggest group tours that I could just join without having to form my own group beforehand? \n\nAnother thing, I\u2019ve heard that April can be busy with tourists\u2014should I book homestays, hostels, tours etc in advance, or is it easy to find places on the go?\n\nAny insights or advice would be really appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019m getting a little overwhelmed trying to plan out my Thailand itinerary and am looking for suggestions. Here is my rough plan:\n\nDay 1: early arrival to Phuket\nDay 2-3: Phuket \nDay 4: ferry to Krabi\nDay 5-6: Krabi\nDay 7: flight to Chiang Mai, early in the day \nDay 8: Chiang Mai\nDay 9: Chiang Mai, sleeper train to Bangkok at night\nDay 10-14: Bangkok, planning to leave Day 14 either early or night bus to Siem Reap (undecided)\n\nI think I\u2019m happy with my Chiang Mai/Bangkok time, but unsure about my time in the south. I\u2019m flying into Phuket so need to spend at least one day there. \n\nPart of the issue is that I\u2019m coming in mid May, and the weather is unpredictable. I\u2019m hoping to keep some of my plans flexible, as in not booking tours, but I\u2019m worried about missing out. I\u2019ve also heard it\u2019s better to book in person but not sure how to do that. \n\nI\u2019m also not sure if I\u2019m splitting my time between Phuket and Krabi well. I have 3 days in Phuket, because the night of day 3 in a Sunday, and the Sunday night market is on my wish list. I\u2019m looking at staying around Kata Beach in Phuket (more for affordability), and Ao Nang (though possibly Krabi Town) in Krabi. \n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of sitting around on a beach all day. I\u2019d like to do day trips to places like Phi Phi Island, Koh Hong, Phang Nga Bay. I\u2019d like to do some snorkelling, see some monkeys (saving the elephants for Chiang Mai), see some nature like caves, mangroves, waterfalls. A few temples. I\u2019m thinking of doing my day boat trips from Phuket because there\u2019s more nature around Ao Nang that interests me. I don\u2019t plan on renting a scooter or car. \n\nI considered going to the eastern islands but  since I\u2019m flying into Phuket, it doesn\u2019t make sense. From what I\u2019ve read they\u2019re more beachy and harder to get around (I\u2019m not an outgoing person, and this trip is already going outside my comfort zone). \n\nAny suggestions (or reassurances) are appreciated!

        "selftext": "Hii! \nI'm planning a 12 days trip to Vietnam (north and central regions) next month and I'm sort of hesitating after reading some stuff about Vietnam even though it is my top dream destination. \n\nI read that you can't rely on reviews since they're mostly fake/bought by restaurant and hotel owners, and that you have to be careful where to buy your sim card since you will most likely be sold a used one. And that you'll have to be ready to do a lot of haggling for prices otherwise you'll be scammed. \nA lot of tips given regarding these issues involve socializing with the locals to get recommendations from them and winging it along the way to experiment with stuff.\nNow the real problem is not the things I've read, it's that I have crippling social anxiety so I don't think I can manage chatting up locals that probably don't even speak English well to get their recommendations, and haggling is a traumatic experience for me, and I'm so very terrified from going there without planning everything down to the restaurants I will eat at every day. I don\u2019t even think I can manage to buy stuff at a local market with fixed prices.\n\nThis will be my second time solo travelling and I'm doubtful if I can actually make it in Vietnam and enjoy my trip. Any tips on how I can plan my trip with these issues on the table? Do you think I can enjoy my trip in Vietnam or am I being unrealistic and should switch to an easier destination? Anything else that I need to know about Vietnam before going there?",

        "selftext": "I guess you could say I\u2019m ready to be in a relationship now. I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years single after a pretty toxic relationship. But I didn\u2019t realise how much I craved a partner until this trip. Seeing couples travelling together I feel so jealous. Back home I live in a pretty smallish town and it feels impossible to meet anyone decent, the good ones are all taken it seems. Everyone my age (30) is settled down, having kids. I don\u2019t think I want children and it seems like every man I meet is in that stage of wanting kids too. So I think I secretly hoped I would meet someone who wants the same things as me travelling. But instead I think most guys here are just wanting something casual and to have fun. \n\nLast year I did a 6 week trip to Thailand and had fun and wasn\u2019t against fleeting romances. But even there, where hookup culture was strong, it still felt like the guys were open to travelling together for a week or two and wanted something abit more than just a hookup. But not here (Central America) which is surprisingly. I feel like every person I\u2019m attracted to isn\u2019t into me and the guys who are, I\u2019m not attracted to them. I\u2019ve had a few rejections, a guy I was into ghosted me today. And I know these guys are essentially strangers and I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me, but it does. I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any tips on how to not put too much expectations on to people and how to detach and move past rejection? \n\nI can feel my confidence growing on this trip and it\u2019s a really nice feeling. I\u2019m becoming more confident within myself, learning to trust my instincts and enjoying my own company. But rejection still seems to be something I\u2019m not great at navigation yet. I don\u2019t want to waste my trip/ life thinking gagging for a relationship or being sad over rejection. ",

Lately I've been cool with trying new things, but there are certain kinds of dishes that gross me out beyond belief.

I also have a hard time eating seafood, the texture and smell make it seem gross. All of the above are usually staple in the Japanese diet, and I have tried almost all of those above besides Natt\u014d.\n\nGiven I grew up based around an Italian diet (lots of pasta and bread), would someone like me be able to survive if I were to travel to Japan? Again, I'm not totally closed off to trying new foods, so really what I'm asking is: are there any foods that someone like me could slowly adapt to within the Japanese diet?\n\nNot Japanese, but I recently tried butter chicken after being worried I wouldn't like it and I ended up liking it quite a lot. Same goes for guacamole, used to think I wouldn't like it but it's actually something I eat at least once a week now.\n\nedit: What's with all the downvotes?

I was arrived morning of 5 March and left 10 March afternoon.  \n\nThe purpose of this solo trip is to experience hostel life and get used to socialising again! Since i\u2019ll be moving from Sg to London for masters. My job and uni experience are largely remote and it\u2019s been a while since i made friends, i was quite socially awkward and struggled this trip haha. Most of my irl friends are female too so i was terrified of men too. \n\nItinerary: \nMy itinerary initially was to explore the outdoorsy stuff but the weather was unfortunately less than ideal. I\u2019m also from  singapore so i underpacked bc i was told the weather there would be low 20 degree celcius. I drank at bars one night, but halfway through i caught a cold and ended up sleeping early like 11pm i was already in my pjs. Unfortunately had to turn down some drinks and activities bc i was lethargic. \n\nHostel was 10 minutes walk from ximending which is great for shopping and convenience. Its also about 20 minutes walk from LongShan temple. The route to these destinations are full of unassuming roadside stalls/restaurants that are honestly great and really cheap. I think they taste way better than the food at ximending tbh. Found some cool dessert and pastries places to eat at and they were really delicious too! The cool weather made it great to climb elephant mountain too, however I wasnt too sure about jiufen/shifen. \n\nAn old schoolmate of mine also happened to be in the city at the same time as me but left on my day 2, he gave me some pointers of good wet-weather plan activities. Id recommend da dao cheng pier for drinks and vibes, just that the food isnt taiwanese, mostly japanese.\n\nSocials:\nMet different types of people during the limited amount of \u201cphysically healthy\u201d time i had. Saw travellers of different backgrounds (age, country, education, etc). Met americans, europeans, fellow southeast asians, and even talked to locals at the hostel. Realised i easily vibe with people closer to my age and learnt a lot about myself too!! \n\nI wished i had exchanged contact or socials with some of them. I dont have the habit of asking people for their socials bc i find it weird. If you happened to meet someone like me or know someone who met me, let me know? \n\nAnyways, i think a 6D5N trip is just nice to cover a lot of activities and day trips. I was bored out of my mind half the trip though bc on saturday i was feeling faint and light headed and by sunday i was having a full blown chills and fever. Quite upsetting, was planning to visit jiufen since the weather had cleared up by then, i guess fate isnt on my side.",

My job and uni experience are largely remote and it\u2019s been a while since i made friends, i was quite socially awkward and struggled this trip haha. Most of my irl friends are female too so i was terrified of men too. \n\nItinerary: \nMy itinerary initially was to explore the outdoorsy stuff but the weather was unfortunately less than ideal. I\u2019m also from  singapore so i underpacked bc i was told the weather there would be low 20 degree celcius. I drank at bars one night, but halfway through i caught a cold and ended up sleeping early like 11pm i was already in my pjs. Unfortunately had to turn down some drinks and activities bc i was lethargic. \n\nHostel was 10 minutes walk from ximending which is great for shopping and convenience. Its also about 20 minutes walk from LongShan temple. The route to these destinations are full of unassuming roadside stalls/restaurants that are honestly great and really cheap. I think they taste way better than the food at ximending tbh. Found some cool dessert and pastries places to eat at and they were really delicious too! The cool weather made it great to climb elephant mountain too, however I wasnt too sure about jiufen/shifen. \n\nAn old schoolmate of mine also happened to be in the city at the same time as me but left on my day 2, he gave me some pointers of good wet-weather plan activities. Id recommend da dao cheng pier for drinks and vibes, just that the food isnt taiwanese, mostly japanese.\n\nSocials:\nMet different types of people during the limited amount of \u201cphysically healthy\u201d time i had. Saw travellers of different backgrounds (age, country, education, etc). Met americans, europeans, fellow southeast asians, and even talked to locals at the hostel. Realised i easily vibe with people closer to my age and learnt a lot about myself too!! \n\nI wished i had exchanged contact or socials with some of them. I dont have the habit of asking people for their socials bc i find it weird. If you happened to meet someone like me or know someone who met me, let me know? \n\nAnyways, i think a 6D5N trip is just nice to cover a lot of activities and day trips. I was bored out of my mind half the trip though bc on saturday i was feeling faint and light headed and by sunday i was having a full blown chills and fever. Quite upsetting, was planning to visit jiufen since the weather had cleared up by then, i guess fate isnt on my side.",

        "selftext": "I am flying from UK to Turkey (Dalaman) In 1 week. The plan is to hike the Lycian Way and then stay in Antalya for a week to recuperate and chill before travelling around Turkey and ending in Istanbul. After that I want to get the overnight bus to Sofia in Bulgaria (this will be after approx 2 months in Turkey)\n\nWill I have any problems with the airline or immigration by travelling on a 1 way ticket? Should I buy the bus ticket to Bulgaria now as proof of onward travel? Alternatively I could buy a very cheap flight from Istanbul to London (\u00a325) and then probably not use it and get the bus to Bulgaria instead. I just don't want any stress about entering the country sine it's my 1st trip abroad for a long time and I'm already a little nervous\n\nAlso, any recommendations of places to visit on my month or so from Antalya to Istanbul would be much appreciated - thanks!",

The advice and insight I received from this sub was super helpful so I thought I'd come back with a trip report of everything I did/my itinerary in case it's useful to anyone else! I didn't have a specific budget in mind when I booked this trip, just wanted it to be fun, and I stayed in a mix of hotels and private rooms in hostels. The only thing I'd add is that I regret not adding more time to do the Ha Giang loop, everyone I spoke to said it was the highlight of their lives and I would go back to Vietnam just to do this. Other than this, happy to answer any questions!\n\n**Days 1 & 2**: Danang\n\n* Flew from Taipei to Da Nang and spent two whole days here. This was deliberately designed to be relaxing given I had a pretty demanding week prior in Taiwan at a work conference.\n* Day 1: Just got a manicure and pedicure, walked around and tried the different types of food here, took my towel and book to the beach and just read. I found the food significantly cheaper here than anywhere else in Vietnam I visited!\n* Day 2: Had a late start to the day, went for a run along the beachfront, and then chilled out at Maia Beach Bar/Club for the day. Got food, a massage, and then dinner.\n* **Accommodation**: Stayed at a hotel for this one, [HAIAN Beach Hotel and Spa](https://haianbeachhotelspa.com/), was fine\n\n**Days 3-5**: Hoi An\n\n* Took a Grab car from Da Nang to Hoi An. I'd heard this town was extremely nice/idyllic and I am really glad I listened to other travellers and spent more time here.\n* Day 3: Immediately upon arriving I went to the tailor to get a bunch of dresses and nice outfits made for a few weddings and special occasions I'll be attending this year. At the recommendation of my hostel owner I went to [Tuong Tailors](https://www.tuongtailor.com/) and had an amazing experience; a bit on the pricier side compared to other places but I felt the service was white glove and extremely catered to me, I didn't ever feel rushed and received a lot of individual attention. 5/6 of the pieces I had custom made for me I absolutely loved. Rest of the day I just walked around the old town, got a banh mi from Madam Kanh Butterfly, borrowed a bicycle and went cycling to the rice paddies stopping for a fruit juice at Roving Chillhouse, then went back into town and had an UNREAL dinner at TinTin restaurant (the ban xhue was out of this world).\n* Day 4: I did a cooking class organized through my hostel along wth the coconut boat ride and spinning thing. Not going to lie to you, I had a BLAST on that thing and really enjoyed myself. This was from 1:30-6:30p.m., then I went to get adjustments done at the tailor's. After this I went to the night market with friends I made at the hostel and then we went for beers.\n* Day 5: Went with people from the hostel to the beach and spent several hours there. Biked back into town and picked up my clothes from the tailor's, showered, packed, met with friends for dinner and then we all went out dancing to Tiger Tiger Bar (it was fun)!!\n* **Accommodation**: [Cheerful Hoi An Hostel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tanphuonghomestay.en-gb.html). I really loved it, the owner is like a Vietnamese mother to you and it's a chill hostel where it's easy to meet people without it being a party hostel. I stayed in the private room with a balcony, it was great!\n\n**Day 6**: Hanoi\n\n* Flew to Hanoi from Da Nang international airport. Mostly was overwhelmed, admittedly, by the general chaos of the city. I walked around the Old Quarter, took a rest in my hostel (I stayed in a private room at [Buffalo Hostel](https://buffalohostels.com/) which was exceptional, surprisingly- felt like a hotel room effectively).\n\n**Days 7 & 8**: Ha Long Bay cruise\n\n* I booked the Hideaway Ha Long Bay cruise and had a bit of trepidation given it wasn't marketed as a \"luxurious: or high-end cruise but I am SO SO SO glad I did this! It was LOTS OF FUN- the hostel arranges everything so we left at 7:30a.m. and took a mix of buses and ferries/speedboats to get to the actual boat itself. From there the boat itself was surprisingly beautiful and spacious and took is to a much quieter part of Cat Ba/Ha Long Bay - I didn't see any other tours there and there was no trash at all anywhere. My room was insanely nice. All the food is catered for as well so we had a lunch buffet, then played beach volleyball, had some beers by the fire on the beach, went jumping off the boat, then had hot tub drinks as we sailed along, dinner then dance party in the evening, and kayaking the next morning before coming back. Met some of the best people on this tour.\n* On Day 8 we arrived back in Hanoi around 4:30p.m. so I napped, showered, went to Train Street with someone I met on the boat and got dinner with them afterwards.\n\n**Day 9**: Last day in Hanoi\n\n* I had a midnight flight so I spent the day first getting food, then going to Hao Lo prison museum, then a walk by the lake, a 2-hour spa massage, and then dinner before heading home.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading!",

However, during that extended trip (semi-internship) I never really managed to get out of Taipei.\n\nSo far I just have the start and end of the trip booked. I will start with 5 nights in the capital, for sightseeing, night markets and just to soak up the urban atmosphere.\n\nI then have a couple of nights in Kaoshiung, follow by 3 nights just for pure relaxation down at Nanwan Bay, in Kenting area.\n\nI still have around 4-5 nights to play with, before heading back to Taipei for my flight out.\n\nI would love to experience some more beautiful nature hotspots, maybe some hiking or mountain homestay type activities. I have considered stopping at Alishan, Tainan or Sun Moon Lake on my way back North.\n\nI hear that Hualien's surrounding attractions remain inaccessible due to earthquake damage back in 2024. Although I'm unsure on the latest info.\n\nAnyway, would love to hear any nice recommendations from anyone who has been. Especially in the last 4-5 years.",

I\u2019m particularly interested in: Miyakojima, Yoron, Ishigaki(I\u2019m ok to drop any one of these if necessary to accommodate my short time there). I don\u2019t drive. My questions are: \n\n1. is this doable for a solo traveler that doesn\u2019t drive?\n2. should I focus on just one location, like ishigaki? Or include day trips to places like Yoron?\n3. After some research, I\u2019m not SUPER interested in Naha, but for a solo traveler is it better to use Naha as a base and just do day trips from there? I\u2019d prefer to stay on a smaller island than the main one but if it\u2019s simply not doable as a non driver then I\u2019ll do what is available to me.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to find a ton of information about solo traveling to the smaller islands around Okinawa as a solo traveler who doesn\u2019t drive. I feel like I\u2019m trying to navigate this a bit blinder than places like Tokyo or Kyoto that have way more resources. \n\nPriorities would be to be in nature, be a bit more slowed down and relaxed than Tokyo, stargaze, snorkel, eat Okinawan food, visit some cute shops, etc. no interest in visiting the America town etc.",

        "selftext": "**Hi everyone,**\n\nAs always, my friends canceled on me, but I\u2019ve suddenly discovered the newfound freedom of going on an adventure by myself. Sooooo...\n\nI\u2019ll be traveling to Bangkok in July for four days, followed by Cebu, Manila, and Boracay, then spending my last week in Hong Kong before returning to the mundane world of the West. I\u2019ve already booked all my flights and hotels. Since I\u2019m Filipino, my plans in the Philippines are already arranged, and so is my Hong Kong trip since my mother works there and has told me all the places and people she wants me to visit.\n\nHowever, I feel a bit disorganized when it comes to Thailand. I want to approach this trip as laid-back as possible while still experiencing the city's culture. By \u2018laid-back,\u2019 I mean I don\u2019t want to book tours that require me to wake up very early in the morning. Additionally, I\u2019d like to avoid places with alcohol\u2014mainly because I\u2019m a newbie solo traveler. The only places I\u2019ve traveled solo so far are Spain and Scotland, and I don\u2019t want to find myself in an unusual situation.\n\nSooo, I was hoping you could give me some inspiration on where to go and what to do to experience the food and culture of Thailand.

I have already asked around 30 people to click my photos, sometimes 2 or 3 times at the same spot with different people until I get the perfect picture. At Shibuya Sky, I think I asked around 10 people just there lol.\n\nNo one has ever said no. I actually enjoy doing this because it helps me start small conversations. I always offer to take their pictures too, and it feels nice to share that moment with strangers.\n\nThe problem is I feel like I am spending more time trying to get the perfect pic instead of exploring. But if I do not get a good picture, I feel like I am missing out. These pictures are not even for social media as I don\u2019t post anything, they are just for me to look at.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? How do you balance taking pictures and enjoying the moment? I know some people don\u2019t click any pictures of themselves but I can\u2019t help but think future me would appreciate these pictures..\n\nEdit: thanks guys I appreciate your comments. I feel the trade off with spending time taking pic's for me personally is worth it.

        "selftext": "I am in Berlin solo travelling as a woman in my early 30s. \n\nLast night, a Ukrainian guy checked into my dorm and we talked about music, when I realized he was into metal too, I told him there was a nice pub I could show him food for the music we liked.\n\nSo we went, he was so drunk he could barely stand up and I walked him back after just one beer. \n\nHe tried to kiss me, I refused, and then among other things, he told me laughing about how he hurt his cat. Immediately I was like \"fuck no\" and quickly got back to the hostel. On the stairs he started asking me to have sex in my bed and kiss him again, I ran away and hid in my bed which I have curtains around for privacy. \n\nI just wanted him to stay away from me. \n\nThen this morning, I am lying in my bed and after slamming doors all morning and keeping the dorm awake, he intruded into my private space, opening the curtains, leaning in and touching my leg and asking me for morning sex. I immediately grabbed my shoes and ran downstairs to ask the staff for help.\n\nThey have been very good and they have kicked him out, supported me, but I have only just stopped shaking. \n\nI don't want to be scared of men or the world, I have not had this in all the 16+ years I have backpacked solo. But I would appreciate if I could have some words of comfort. He is gone from the room now but I don't want to be alone, I am sat at the hostel bar still in my pajamas.\n\nI am not a woman who scares easily, I've been to some dodgy places (like a football uktras match in Balkan Europe) and have met all kinds of people, part of the reason I am in Berlin is to go to places like Insomnia and KitKat. \n\nI am trying to not blame myself. \n\nEdit - I know about female only dorms and do book them when I can, but at the same time, I shouldn't have to be in a room exclusively for women so I don't get assaulted in my own bed. Men should be able to control themselves. One of the first things I asked was if I could be moved to a female only dorm (hostel is full) and then, in the past I have met some great people, including a 65 year old Iranian man who got me medication when I was ill in Sofia, Bulgaria last year and gave me his Istanbul metro.card - a baba to me really. \n\nI can't believe I have been assaulted and there are people saying there are holes and I am lying, I have a photo with the fucking guy! If there are any tech savvos out there, I will send it to you so you can view the capture data or whatever you call it when you can see where and when a photo was taken.",

I have an office job and while the salary is decent, I don\u2019t like the work and am yearning for a change. Before I look for a new job, I\u2019d love to go on a 1-ish year solo trip in Asia. My current idea is to quit in April of this year, which would line up nicely with summer break/leaving for Japan in September.\n\nI\u2019ve saved enough money (I think), around USD 40k. However, with the absolute madhouse that is geopolitics currently, I am quite anxious about making a big change, even though I feel like I desperately need it. The thought of a larger war in Europe breaking out scares me and makes me doubt that leaving my comfort zone and my family is the best way forward. Also, with the current economic outlook, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d immediately find a job after returning (I do have a safety cushion of around 30k though). At this point, I\u2019d say I\u2019m 60% leaning towards quitting + travelling.\n\nIf you have any advice for me, I\u2019d much appreciate it. Thanks!",

I was awake by 11 a.m. and decided to head straight into the city to check out Shinjuku.\n\nI went into Uniqlo, browsed for a bit, bought a few things, and left. Took a left down an alley and noticed a group of people, some tourists, some who seemed like locals, just standing there. I didn\u2019t think much of it and kept walking.

        "selftext": "I have just been laid off, and have decided to take this time to explore the world. My initial instinct was to focus on just one region of the world (either S.E Asia or Europe). However, I am concerned about boredom. I understand each country in SE Asia is unique (but still a part of the same region with comparable norms and vibes), but I have never been to SE Asia, nor have I ever travelled for this long continuously. I need some advice from people who have been on this path if I should follow this \u2018buffet style\u2019 travel which gives me completely different cultures and continents every few weeks, or if I should go for a slower pace in a more concentrated region.\n\nThis is a list of places I have in mind, in what I reckon is manageable pace (Please correct me if I\u2019m being an idiot!).\u00a0\n\n\n\nKuala Lumpur - 4\n\nSingapore - 4\n\nLaos - 8\n\nVietnam - 25 (Ha Giang, Hanoi, Ha long bay, Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Hoi An)\n\nTokyo - 7\n\nSeoul - 7\n\nNYC- 8\u00a0\n\nIceland - 8\n\nVienna - 5\n\nBratislava - 2\n\nPrague - 4\n\nGermany - 8 (Berlin, Dresden)\n\nAmsterdam - 3\n\n\n\nJust some information about myself: I love exploring new cultures and seeing how people live in different places. While nature and hiking are definitely things I want to do, I feel cities are what I find most interesting. I love food, art, museums, and most of all, walking around a city getting lost. I have about 32k USD saved up, and am willing to go longer than the 3 months planned if I am not burnt out at that point. So I am asking for advice on two things:\u00a0\n\n\n\n1. Whether to prioritize slow travel or fast paced like above (Boredom vs burnout) and how to manage these two extremes\n2. Whether to focus on one region or many (Depth vs breadth).\n\n\n\nIn addition to advice, I would also love for you to add your recommendations on things you have done, experiences, hikes, hidden gems in any of these places.

        "selftext": "*Hi folks, I tried to post in* r/Cambodia *but didn't get too much feedback. So I thought I would post here. I read some other itineraries but didn't see any catered to a three week timeline coming from Laos and heading to Indonesia afterwards so I thought I would do a fresh post.*\n\nI am arriving from Laos in a few weeks and planning to spend 2-3 weeks in Cambodia before flying to indonesia. I have a rough itinerary but want some more advice and recommendations.\n\nAbout me: 26M, solo traveller. I like doing things independant when possible but prefer not to drive a motorcycle. I love nature of all kinds. I spent a month in laos and Vietnam before this and some of my favorite destinations were Dalat, Ha Giang, and Nong Khiaw. Any recommendations would be great!\n\nDay 1-2: Preah Romkel - Preah Nimit waterfall and entering Cambodia (QUESTION: Would it be possible to get to ratnakiri province in same travel day and start my journey there instead?)\n\nDay 3-9: Siem Reap - Ankor Watt and Pnom Kulen\n\nDay 9-12: Battambang - more temples\n\nDay 13-17: Koh Rong Sanloem - beach\n\nDay 18-21: Phenom Penh - killing fields and other history experiences\n\nI open to any suggestions that would allow me to see some more quiet and remote places. I try to avoid travelling too fast so I can still really experience places well. Considering that I am heading to indonesia afterwards, I considered cancelling Koh Rong Sanloem as well. As I mentioned above, I am also interested in Ratnakiri and Mondulkiri but not sure how similar they will be to nature I have already explored in Laos and Vietnam.\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "I'm a 24F who travelled to Japan last year in September and I am really craving a trip back there.\n\nFor some background info, I've been overseas a few times before but they were always with family. My trip last year was with two family members but I did have a lot of independence and got to do my own thing majority of the time. I also recently took a week long solo trip by myself a few hours away from home and loved it. Evidently I've got the itch to travel more!\n\nI'm wondering if it would be worth going back to Japan as I really loved it (apart from it being too humid which is why I would go at a colder time of year like November) or go somewhere different? Other countries I'm interested in are the United States and going around Europe, however USA is a place I'm a bit too nervous about going by myself and Europe I'm planning a trip for in a few years.\n\nHave you ever gone to the same place two times in a row? Or I'm wondering if I should focus more on solo travel in my home country (Australia) even though I have seen a fair bit of it. Any advice would be appreciated!",

        "selftext": "I (25M) am leaving tonight for my first solo trip. I stumbled upon this sub maybe 6-7 years ago, fresh out of high school/early in college (US) with aspirations to \u201csee the world.\u201d I grew up in a NYC suburb, and now live and work in Manhattan. No one in my family travels much for pleasure outside of a few beach vacations to the Caribbean. I had only been outside of the US to travel to Aruba up until about 18 months ago. \n\nFinding this sub by chance has lead me to read hundreds of stories, learn about people\u2019s experiences, and come to understand that there is so much that can be done alone. \n\nI have been fortunate enough to have started truly traveling, and over the last 18 months have been to Europe 3 times, and am in the beginning stages of planning a few other over the next 18 months, including a possible trip to Japan / SE Asia.  \n\nTraveling solo is pretty far outside my comfort zone, due to a couple factors, but is something I genuinely believe I am going to love. I enjoy solace, and meeting new people. Having new experiences, and challenging myself. Without finding this sub and hearing all of the collective encouragement from its members over the years, this is something I would\u2019ve never even considered, and now, regardless of the nerves, and fear of the unknown, I am ecstatic to be embarking on this journey with myself, and consequently, with all of you. \n\n Those who come across this and are contemplating a solo trip, do it. No matter the distance, duration, or location, try something new, discomfort is okay, and be open to what\u2019s out there because you never know what you may find!",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been traveling consistently for about 4 years in Asia/ India and once Europe. I go back to the USA about two months out of every year to work and see family. Everytime I go back to the U.S. I realize how lacking in community I am. Like I have no \u201clife\u201d if that makes sense. I know a lot of people but and have many friends around the world but only from mostly brief times. I\u2019ve made up my mind multiple times that I need to go back to the USA and establish myself. It\u2019s not possible to establish myself overseas because I don\u2019t have enough work. I have tired a few times to \u201crestart\u201d my life in USA. I last a couple months and then I feel trapped and find myself booking a ticket to the other side of the world. Then I\u2019m sitting  alone at a cafe wondering why I\u2019m still doing this. It\u2019s at the point where I know it\u2019s not healthy and I\u2019ve been talking to my therapist about it, I just don\u2019t know how to stop. Anyone else with similar experience and how did you handle it?",

Is it too rushed, or does it seem good? For Sumatra, my main interest is seeing orangutans and I added an extra night to explore the area, but I'm not sure if I can extend my stay further\n\nEDIT: If I could get one more night, where would it be best to spend it?",

Overall, I would give the trip a 3/5 stars for various reasons I'm happy to get into if anyone has questions, but I would give their customer support and the company itself a 0/5 stars for how they responded to my feedback about the trip. \n\nAbout a week after the trip, I got an email asking me to provide feedback which was presented as solely for internal review and trip improvement purposes. The survey got into sensitive/personal subjects such as how safe I felt on the trip, how much I liked my roommate, etc. Near the end, there are some opt-in questions about whether I would want Flash Pack to contact me about going on future trips or to allow Flash Pack to share my experiences in their Backpackers newsletter, neither of which I opted into. I also shared my honest, negative feedback about some of the hotel selections and some misleading representations by the company about what the activities would include (ex., the Bali Immersion - Day 7 pictures and activities list made it sound like we would take a beautiful, private speed boat to Nusa Penida but we actually took a large, very old, crowded and smelly ferry over).\n\nAbout two months after the trip, I get an email from Flash Pack saying that they were making some changes to the trip in response to the feedback and that they were offering a $300 USD refund or $400 USD credit towards a future trip as a \"gesture of good will.\" I then took a look at the Bali immersion page and saw that one of the few positive comments I shared in the feedback request had been posted without my consent in the Community Highlights section. I asked that the comment be taken down, to which I got two non-committal \"we've made a request and will provide an update\" responses. Then, when I tried to accept the $300 USD refund offer, Flash Pack said that I had to also effectively agree to an NDA in order to receive the refund. I was shocked that Flash Pack tried to buy my silence and get me to waive my right to discuss this trip online, when hypocritically they had basically already forced me to discuss this trip online misleadingly by only sharing my few nice comments. I refused the refund and NDA, and after laying into them one more time, they did finally take down my comment. However, the fact that they posted it in the first place, then took 7 emails for them to actually take it down, all while trying to get me not to talk about them honestly online, was appalling to me.  \n",

I\u2019m skipping Central Vietnam (Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue) since I\u2019ve heard the weather is too unpredictable that time of year. Instead, I\u2019m focusing on the north (Hanoi, Ha Giang, Ninh Binh), then heading south (Dalat, Nha Trang, HCMC).\n\n  \n**One thing I wanted to add: I've heard northern Vietnam is far more interesting than the south and I would also be willing to completely scrap the south for more destinations in the northern including Cat Ba/Ha Long if that would be a better use of my time.**\n\nItinerary:\n\nDec 10: Fly to Vietnam  \nDec 11-13: Hanoi (3 days)  \nDec 14-17: Ha Giang Loop (4 days)  \nDec 18-20: Ninh Binh (3 days)  \nDec 21: Fly from Hanoi to Dalat  \nDec 22-23: Dalat (2 days)  \nDec 24: Travel to Nha Trang  \nDec 25-26: Nha Trang (2 days)  \nDec 27: Fly to Ho Chi Minh City  \nDec 28-29: Ho Chi Minh City (2 days)  \nDec 30: Fly back home\n\nQuestions:\n\n1.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI\u2019m currently on a solo backpacking trip on my way to Australia for a WHV (F30). I just spent a week in Japan, currently in Hanoi for a week and Saigon next week til 12th of March. \n\nI was diagnosed with BPD, depression & anxiety about a decade ago and have struggled with it since then, on and off medications and in and out of therapy etc. I had a really awful break up last year which I\u2019m still healing from, with someone who now views my mental health as the main problem in our relationship. It wasn\u2019t, but I won\u2019t get into all that. The point is my experiences from late last year seem to be coming up a lot for me right now and exacerbating my symptoms. \n\nI\u2019ve been in Hanoi since Wednesday and honestly I\u2019ve done nothing. I can\u2019t seem to leave my hostel room, and every time I try the anxiety overwhelms me. As is also the case with depression, I\u2019m feeling very immobilised and I\u2019m worried if this slump continues I\u2019m going to waste a trip to Vietnam that I\u2019ve been planning for years.  It\u2019s such an amazing country and I really don\u2019t want to be stuck inside like this. Has anyone else had similar experiences? How did you get out of your slump? \n\nAlso I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how great it would be if there was a therapy service specifically for people who are travelling - would anyone know of such a service? (Not BetterHelp). \n\nThanks in advance if anyone has any advice. \n\n**UPDATE** \n\nThank you everyone so much for your kind words and advice/help, especially those who messaged me personally and gave me great advice on places to go in Hanoi!\nI can confirm as of today I\u2019ve left my hostel, had great food, great drinks (mainly those iced egg coffees, damn), walked around a lot, and crossed multiple roads! Anyone who\u2019s been to Hanoi will know how challenging this part is at first lol\n\nI\u2019m taking steps to make contact with UK based therapists to see if anyone is willing to navigate the time difference and offer remote sessions. If not, there do seem to be a lot of virtual counselling services that aren\u2019t BetterHelp, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m out of options.\nFor now, I\u2019m just taking it easy in Hanoi - I have a cruise to Ha Long booked tomorrow, which I think will be a fairly chilled out activity for going further afield. \n\nAgain I really do appreciate everyone\u2019s help with this! Can\u2019t say thank you enough \u2764\ufe0f",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI\u2019m currently on a solo backpacking trip on my way to Australia for a WHV (F30). I just spent a week in Japan, currently in Hanoi for a week and Saigon next week til 12th of March. \n\nI was diagnosed with BPD, depression & anxiety about a decade ago and have struggled with it since then, on and off medications and in and out of therapy etc. I had a really awful break up last year which I\u2019m still healing from, with someone who now views my mental health as the main problem in our relationship. It wasn\u2019t, but I won\u2019t get into all that. The point is my experiences from late last year seem to be coming up a lot for me right now and exacerbating my symptoms. \n\nI\u2019ve been in Hanoi since Wednesday and honestly I\u2019ve done nothing. I can\u2019t seem to leave my hostel room, and every time I try the anxiety overwhelms me. As is also the case with depression, I\u2019m feeling very immobilised and I\u2019m worried if this slump continues I\u2019m going to waste a trip to Vietnam that I\u2019ve been planning for years.  It\u2019s such an amazing country and I really don\u2019t want to be stuck inside like this. Has anyone else had similar experiences? How did you get out of your slump? \n\nAlso I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how great it would be if there was a therapy service specifically for people who are travelling - would anyone know of such a service? (Not BetterHelp). \n\nThanks in advance if anyone has any advice. \n\n**UPDATE** \n\nThank you everyone so much for your kind words and advice/help, especially those who messaged me personally and gave me great advice on places to go in Hanoi!\nI can confirm as of today I\u2019ve left my hostel, had great food, great drinks (mainly those iced egg coffees, damn), walked around a lot, and crossed multiple roads! Anyone who\u2019s been to Hanoi will know how challenging this part is at first lol\n\nI\u2019m taking steps to make contact with UK based therapists to see if anyone is willing to navigate the time difference and offer remote sessions. If not, there do seem to be a lot of virtual counselling services that aren\u2019t BetterHelp, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m out of options.\nFor now, I\u2019m just taking it easy in Hanoi - I have a cruise to Ha Long booked tomorrow, which I think will be a fairly chilled out activity for going further afield. \n\nAgain I really do appreciate everyone\u2019s help with this! Can\u2019t say thank you enough \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be fine, but would the Hanoi-Sapa trip twice in three nights be really unpleasant?\n* Relatedly, Sapa feels like a particularly massive investment of travel time. The nature looks incredible though and I am reading great things about village homestays.\n* Going to Hue and Hoi An in the amount of time I\u2019ve allotted seems like it might be a bit flat out. But they both seem really nice and so does the Hue-Da Nang train between them.\n\nI would really appreciate anyone\u2019s thoughts on whether / what I should cut further, or how I should decide!

        "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI recently just completed an amazing 5 months of travelling through Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. While I was away I recorded all of my expenses using google forms and saved them to a google sheet. As a fun little side project while away, I decided to conduct some data analysis on all my spending through 4 different countries over 5 months. Thought I would post this information to Reddit so anyone planning a trip can get a pretty good idea of what to budget for these countries!\n\nThe full notebook is available on my[ github](https://github.com/Jessep123/Funemployment/blob/main/Funemployment_FINAL.ipynb) and has a relatively extensive breakdown of my overall expenses + each countries cost to travel. Will also chuck some key information below. Everything below will be in $USD.\n\n**Daily Expenses in Each Country**\n\nNepal\n\n* Total - $25.87\n* Food - $14.2\n* Accom - $3.5\n\nThailand\n\n* Total - $45.4\n* Food - $15.6\n* Accom - $12.9\n\nVietnam\n\n* Total - $41\n* Food - $16\n* Accom - $10.3\n\nCambodia\n\n* Total - $37.5\n* Food - $18.8\n* Accom - $9.1\n\nIf anyone has questions, feel free to reach out! One of the hardest parts about preparing to go away for so long was figuring out, exactly how much I would realistically be spending while away.\n\nI would say I was travelling relatively mid-lowish expense wise. I was definitely on the cheaper end of things, but not trying to squeeze every cent. You probably could travel cheaper than this if you tried and it wouldn't be hard to go more expensive than this either.\n\n  \n",

One of the hardest parts about preparing to go away for so long was figuring out, exactly how much I would realistically be spending while away.\n\nI would say I was travelling relatively mid-lowish expense wise. I was definitely on the cheaper end of things, but not trying to squeeze every cent.

The dates aren't set though, I'll just need to leave from Hanoi on the 27th (unless it's not crazy to try to go from Ha Giang to Hong Kong?)\n* I recognize this plan has basically two full travel days on the 18th and 20th, but I figure this allows me to not break up my time in Hanoi. Open to suggestions on better approaches though.\n* I'm very torn between wanting to split my time in nature and in cities. In this current plan I worry I won't have enough time to truly appreciate Hanoi, but having taken a look at Ninh Binh it feels unskippable! Is 3 nights / 2 days enough time in Hanoi to get a good impression and see a lot, or should I just save Ninh Binh for a future trip?\n* I'd love to enjoy some of Hanoi's nightlife. How is the nightlife scene on a Thurs. vs. Fri. vs. Sat, or is it cosmopolitan enough that there are parties to be found any night of the week?\n\nThanks in advance <3",

I AM SO EXCITED!!!  The first available spot is on May 19, 2026, so I have plenty of time to plan an awesome adventure! I want to make the most of that trip, but I'm also not made of either time or money, so I'm trying to figure out the minimum number of days I should spend in Viet Nam to get a good feel for the country & culture. \n\nKnowing that 6 days will be taken up by my Son Doong trek near Dong Hoi. Would another 10 days be enough? 12? More?   \nI would love itinerary suggestions, knowing I'll arrive in Hanoi and can fly out either from Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, that I'm not really a big city person, and that like you run-of-the-mill solo traveler, I'm very flexible it terms of transportation, love the outdoors, the ocean, cool geographical features (hence the cave expedition), culture, history, FOOD, familiarizing myself with the local way of life, activities, art, etc.  \n  \nCan't wait to get some recommendations :) TIA!\n\n",

        "selftext": "I (25M) will be taking a subatical to travel SEA from mid October to mid March. \n\nFor context: When travelling I like to do plenty of outdoorsy activities like hiking. I also would like to visit cultural/historical sites. I have the budget to live fairly comfortably while travelling but I am used to living on a tight budget while travelling. Finally, I'd still like to do plenty of drinking but at 25 I'm more into bars than clubs now. \n\nI'd say the top 3 countries id like to visit based off what I've heard are: Vietnam, Loas, and the Philippines in that order. \n\nI feel like I'd realistically have time to visit about 5 countries during my visit and definitely wouldn't want to do anymore than that. \n\nId be flying from the London so I will likely need to land at a major airport. I know Bangkok is a popular place to start for that reason. I would also like to start in a popular starting place so I can quicky make plan. \n\nI will probably try to keep my plan quite flexible but I'd like to get an idea of where I want to visit so I can list some activities in each place.\n\nI was wondering if I get some advise on what countries to visit and in what order to ensure I avoid burning season etc.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the response so far. My first draft right now is as follows - \n\nThailand (4-5 weeks), Loas (3-4 weeks), Vietnam (6 weeks), Cambodia (3-4 weeks), Sumatra, Indonesia (3-4 weeks), Singapore (5 days or so)\n\nThis should allow me to start and finish at 2 major airports to make finding flights easier. Id love to hear opinions on how long i should spend in each place and if I should change the order! \n\nEdit 2: Sorry if my misspelling of LAos has offended anyone. In my defense I do know how it's pronounced. I honestly didn't notice I had the letters the wrong way round this whole time! I'm sure anyone else with dyslexia can understand how I'd make that mistake haha! ",

Next, take a flight down to Koh Samui then ferry over to Koh Toa and spend 4-5 nights there. Then ferry back to Koh Samui/Koh Pangan (unsure of which to stay at for sightseeing/full moon fest). After that then fly or ferry to Phuket for 3-4 nights and island hop from there (I\u2019ve heard there Isn\u2019t much in Phuket). Finally, fly back to Bangkok for one night before leaving Thailand. \n\nThis is just v.2 I know there are still ways I can improve/things I can change.

        "selftext": "Hey! I started travelling solo two years ago and have visited two cities - Singapore and Sydney in the past two years respectively. I'm planning to visit Singapore again next month to explore more of the city as I didn't have many days while travelling in 2023 and those days were spent mostly in places like Sentosa and the zoo. However, on my past trips, I observed that I feel really self conscious, anxious and lonely while travelling and would like to really \"enjoy\" my trips going forward.\n\nTo give more context, I'm an introvert guy from a South Asian country and being a tall person, I feel I tend to stand out in certain places and feel very self conscious about it. I also tend to overthink and be a lot in my head which does not help in enjoying the moment. As I'm an introvert, its difficult for me to approach or connect with other travellers/people in an informal context. Even though I enjoy my own company, there are times when I feel the need for connection.\n\nAs experienced solo travellers, how do you deal with such issues?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your comments.

Without overthinking, I tacked on 12 extra days: 4 days in London, 4 days in Edinburgh, and 4 days elsewhere in Scotland. I have to return to London to fly back to India (because, well, *travel policy*).\n\nMy plan is super open-ended\u2014aside from my flights and the work week, I haven\u2019t booked anything yet. It\u2019s been ages since my last solo trip, and since the UK didn\u2019t require another visa, this felt like a no-brainer! That said, as an **I**ndian woman (31F) traveling alone, I have some nerves about the logistics of solo travel, especially in unfamiliar places.\n\nWould love suggestions on must-visit spots that are great for a solo traveler, safe, and help me make the most of my trip!\n\n# A little about me:\n\n* I love exploring on foot\u2014whether it\u2019s historic streets, scenic trails, or art-filled alleys.\n* I plan a lot but love spontaneity\u2014if I love a place, I\u2019ll drop my plans and stay longer.\n* Nature and incredible landscapes are my first priority. Breathtaking views > city nightlife.\n* I love architecture, art museums, and street art\u2014but I don't want to spend all my time indoors.\n* Not looking to overbook\u2014I'd rather savor a place than rush through a checklist.\n* Not into heavy nightlife or whiskey bars\u2014I\u2019d rather do scenic train rides, historic spots, or small-group tours.\n\n# Specific questions:\n\n1. Scotland itinerary help \u2013 With 4 days in Edinburgh, should I keep the next 4 days in the Highlands? Isle of Skye? Somewhere less touristy but equally stunning?\n2. Best day trips from London \u2013 Thinking Oxford or the Cotswolds? Any hidden gems?\n3. Must-do experiences \u2013 Any unique tours, scenic hikes, or lesser-known spots I shouldn\u2019t miss?\n4. Safety & solo travel tips \u2013 Any advice for a solo female traveler in these places?\n\nWould love all your tips, experiences, and hidden gems! Thanks in advance. ",

        "selftext": "How has travel changed in SEA over the last years? When I came to Thailand for the first time around 2010 I had nothing but my backpack and a lonely planet. I\u2019d get a room by showing up somewhere, l\u2019d eat wherever it looked tasty and figuring out the activities was basically done on the spot. Even a few years later with a friend - maybe 2015? - we\u2019d basically just wing it. Looking back I wonder if we were simply too dumb to do proper research online, because surely that would\u2019ve been possible ten years ago?\n\nThe \u201cnew\u201d backpackers or travellers seem to do everything different, or maybe that\u2019s just my impression through TikTok. Everything seems to be pre booked - nothing about just showing up and looking for a room, it\u2019s already done through booking.com. \n\nBut how much has it really changed? I\u2019m in the extremely privileged position to take a year off to travel around SEA, not having been there for ten-ish years. Now I wonder how sustainable my former travel style of \u201cwinging it\u201d is - maybe everyone books stuff in advance because it\u2019s the only way to do it, or maybe it\u2019s crazy expensive otherwise? \nI\u2019d love to hear your more recent experiences! \n\n ",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I have a dilemma and I was hoping you guys with experience will be able to help me out. I have a trip planned to Indonesia and I was planning to be there for nearly three months (83 days) . However, looking at visa requirements, I would require a visa-run outside of the country in order to continue the last 3 weeks. That would cost me about $150 CAD if I were to do a visa-run to Malaysia (return flight and visa included - IF I book my flight now) .\n\nThat being said, I had a flight already booked from Indonesia to Seoul on my way home (on day 83). But that flight has been cancelled and I have been given the option to (for free) :\n\n\u2022\t\u2060either rebook for another day or \n\u2022\t\u2060cancel the flight completely.\n\nThat came at a fortuitous time because now I'm conflicted.\n\nI've spoken to a few people who've been to Indonesia and they've told me 60 days was enough (I\u2019ve already spent a month in Lombok last year) and I've spoken to other people who are in Indonesia and they've told me that three months is not enough.\n\nI've already been to Malaysia (although I\u2019m open to returning - loved it there) I'm not interested in going to the Philippines or Sri Lanka or any of the surrounding countries and I've pretty much seen the rest of Southeast Asia.

For example, I know I'll probably visit Thailand at some point due to flight connections.\n\n| #  | Place                           | Weeks Spent | Arrival Around |\n\n|----|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|\n\n| 1  | Turkey                          | 2          | 15 Mar        |\n\n| 2  | Iraqi Kurdistan                 | 1          | 29 Mar        |\n\n| 3  | Iran                             | 3          | 5 Apr         |\n\n| 4  | Karachi to Islamabad (Pakistan) | 2          | 26 Apr        |\n\n| 5  | Karakorum Highway               | 1          | 10 May        |\n\n| 6  | Khunjerab Pass to Beijing       | 2          | 17 May        |\n\n| 7  | North Korea                     | 1          | 31 May        |\n\n| 8  | Mongolia & Inner Mongolia       | 2          | 7 Jun         |\n\n| 9  | Northeastern China              | 2          | 21 Jun        |\n\n| 10 | South Korea                     | 1          | 5 Jul         |\n\n| 11 | Australia                       | 2          | 12 Jul        |\n\n| 12 | Something in Oceania            | 2          | 26 Jul        |\n\n| 13 | Timor, Lombok, Bali             | 2          | 9 Aug         |\n\n| 14 | Jawa, Sumatra                   | 2          | 23 Aug        |\n\n| 15 | Malaysia & Brunei               | 2          | 6 Sep         |\n\n| 16 | EBC Trek (Nepal)                | 4          | 20 Sep        |\n\n| 17 | Vietnam                         | 2          | 18 Oct        |\n\n| 18 | Hainan                          | 1          | 1 Nov         |\n\n| 19 | Taiwan                          | 2          | 8 Nov         |\n\n| 20 | Palau                           | 0.5        | 22 Nov        |\n\n| 21 | Philippines                     | 1.5        | 25 Nov        |\n\n| 22 | Laos                            | 1          | 6 Dec         |\n\n| 23 | Cambodia                        | 1.5        | 13 Dec        |\n\n| 24 | Burma                           | 1          | 23 Dec        |\n\n| 25 | Bangladesh                      | 1          | 30 Dec        |\n\n| 26 | India                           | 2          | 6 Jan         |\n\n| 27 | Oman                            | 1          | 20 Jan        |\n\n| 28 | Saudi Arabia                    | 1          | 27 Jan        |\n\n| 29 | Bahrain                         | 0.5        | 3 Feb         |\n\n| 30 | Kuwait                          | 0.5        | 7 Feb         |\n\n",

I haven\u2019t book a return flight as yet. Does anyone know if India would require me to have a departing flight booked? Although I have some idea of where I\u2019d like to go this time, I\u2019m not all that strict in where I would want to leave. Planning to fly into Delhi and perhaps leaving out of Mumbai, would this need to be decided now? I would ultimately book a flight out of Singapore/Japan back to the states. Should I have this final flight booked ahead of submitting the evisa for India? I have a two backpack system one 40L, 18L and a collapsible one just in case. I teased this out when I backpacked Europe for 2.5 months.\n\nI\u2019m planning to hit the following countries/cities:\n\n**India**: New Delhi, Mumbai - 3 weeks (thought strongly considering staying in North India.) \\* Anyone go to Nepal/Ladak?\n\nPlanning to head out to a couple cities in **Japan**, flying into Tokyo, Kyoto, Okinawa. Whichever I fly into would use a combination of these airports - 3 weeks\n\n**I\u2019d then enter the Banana Pancake trail:**\n\nAt this point I\u2019d spend 2-4 nights in each city\n\n**Thailand**: Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Koh Tao (to Scuba dive): 10-14 days\n\n**Vietnam**: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, Ha Long Bay: 10-14 days\n\n**Cambodia**: Siam Reap - 5-7 days\n\n**Indonesia**: Bali, Jakarta, Nusa Penida: 10-14 days\n\n**Singapore**: 4 days (will likely use this city to fly out)\n\n**Hawaii** \\- 2-3 weeks (I may need to have Japan immediately before Hawaii, either way, don\u2019t care about the order so much, rather just looking for advice on days to allocate)\n\nI\u2019ll be maintaining triathlon prep whenever possible, swimming in pools, running, biking\n\nI practice BJJ so will have a travel Gi with me. And may do some Muay Thai wherever I can rent gear. Would also like to be in some sites for stargazing, hiking.\n\nI have an open water scuba cert, but haven\u2019t dived in about 3 years, from what I\u2019m reading It should be much cheaper to do a refresher in SEA.\n\nIf anyone has experiences with any of these, let me know your recommendations\n\nAside from that would really like to know where I should allocate more time to, skip, remove. From how I have it, I should be back in on mainland USA by the first/second week of June. Right now I just have the plan for Hawaii to steal some days from as needed, and also to break up a long flight back to the states. Used ChatGPT to generate some itineraries but looking to get some anecdotal experiences. **Looking at this plan though, I'm also tempted to keep things to North India, Japan, Bangkok, Singapore at 3 weeks each to experience things at a slower pace in bigger cities**\n\nShould I get an international license to operate motorcycles? I\u2019m open to alternative transporation options like boats, trains, buses",

I have already arranged a somewhat good itinerary (KL, George Town, Perhenthian Islands etc.), with 5-6 days remaining to fill. I am wondering whether it makes sense (or indeed is enough time) taking a flight from KL to somewhere in Borneo (best candidate at the moment is Sandakan) and spend 5 nights and 6 days there.\n\nI read a lot about the fact that Borneo is massive and no way I can see all of it in that little time, but maybe spend a bit of time in the Sandakan area, such as the Orangutan sanctuary, the Bear sanctuary, and a 2 nights/3 days trip across the river in Kinabatangan, doing a river safari. I am definitely interested in doing as much nature activity as possible, and seeing the local wildlife too.\n\nMy question is: has anyone got past experience in doing a similar itinerary, or should I stick to Peninsular Malaysia, add maybe an extra day in Singapore and not visit Borneo? I know that flying to Borneo can be a bit chaotic, as well as moving around there, so I am considering whether it might be worth it or not (considering flights are at least 120+EUR), as well as if it might be too complicated or tiring.\n\nI appreciate any advice you may have!\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Hello! I'm a future solo traveller from Australia (25F) and I'm heading to Vietnam by myself in May this year. It's the first time I've travelled solo for more than a day or two - I'm very excited but also nervous! I'm a bit stuck on what to do for the last portion of my trip, so I'm hoping to get some advice from someone who's been to these areas and could shed light on what would be the best option considering my situation. I'm a plan in advance kind of person and need to know where I'm going to be and how I'm going to get there before I take off :')\n\n**Plan so far:** I'm flying in to Da Nang on the 4th of May. I'm spending 3 nights in Da Nang, 2 nights in Hoi An, then flying to Nha Trang for 3 nights and staying in a hostel.\n\n**What I need help with:** The next part of my trip is where I'm not sure what to do - I will be in Nha Trang until Sunday at least, and I have 3 days to fill (Sunday night to Wednesday) before my flight out of Ho Chi Minh City to Australia on Wednesday afternoon (2 flights with a layover) which has already been booked.\n\n**What I've thought of so far:**\n\n1. Stay in Nha Trang or Dalat for the extra 3 days, then purchase an additional flight from Dalat Airport to Ho Chi Minh City, self-transfer to my flights back to Australia (which means I would have 3 flights in total to get back home which isn't very appealing to me)\n\n2. Get a sleeper bus or private car from Nha Trang to Phan Thiet, stay in a resort for two days (appealing as I need to work on Monday and prefer the quiet), and then get a sleeper bus or private car to Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday morning, arrive at HCMC airport around 10am for my flight in the afternoon\n\n3. Stay in Ho Chi Minh City from Monday to Wednesday. I'm not sure about this, as I've heard from friends that there isn't much to do in HCMC other than party and shop, which isn't really my goal. I have to work remotely on Monday and I will only be taking carry on luggage so I'm not inclined to shop.\n\n4. Maybe there's another idea I'm missing?\n\n\n\nMy main concern is that I want to prioritise reducing my time spent waiting at the airport and take the safest routes especially as I'm a bit concerned about taking sleeper buses for long distances - I am more open to doing this for 3 hours but I'm still not sure whether they're safe. I get quite anxious waiting in long lines at airport security as I worry about missing my flight! \n\n  \nSince my trip is only 10 days long and I'm working remotely during Australian office hours I'm keen to make the most of the short time I do have in Vietnam. Anyone who's been in a similar situation before, I'd really love to hear your thoughts! :) ",

I'll leave some examples below so people get an idea of what I mean. You can speculate, it would be appreciated, obviously we can't know some of these things for certain so you HAVE to speculate but the point is I'd like to visit as many of these time-limited places as I can, and not regret having missed out on some beautiful cultures by having been too late.\n\n#Examples:\n\n__Already passed:__\n\n- Chernobyl Exclusion Zone/Pripyat - can't go there alone without a permit which is not possible for tourists, and tours closed indefinitely since the start of the Ukraine-Russia War [24 Feb 2022, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n- Kyiv, other Ukrainian cities close-ish to the fighting - unlike the above example, which is not visitable at all, places like Kyiv are still visitable for sure but just a bit riskier [24 Feb 2022, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n- Beirut - once called the Paris of the East, this city is now in disarray after constant war, and the massive explosion which plunged the city into further chaos was just the rotten cherry on top. [4 Aug 2020, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n- Israel/Palestine - after 7th October attacks, the region is now not nearly as stable as before, with terror attacks in Tel Aviv just a few days ago as an example. However this region's stability comes and goes like a sin wave, in a few years it should be perfectly safe to visit again. [7 Oct 2023, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n__Likely/certain to happen:__\n\n- Tuvalu - due to climate change and rising sea levels, several of this country's islands are at risk of disappearing [~2050-2100]\n\n- Kiribati - same as above, several islands at risk of being partially/fully submerged. [~2050-2100]\n\n- Maldives - same as above [~2050-2100]\n\n- Marshall Islands - same as above [~2050-2100]\n\n- Glaciers (Switzerland, Glacier National Park in Canada/USA, etc.) - due to climate change, glaciers are getting smaller and smaller, and will eventually disappear. [~2050]\n\n- Coral reefs - if you like scuba diving or snorkelling, coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are eroding away slowly but surely thanks to climate change. [~2060]\n\n- The Baltics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) - the next logical step for Russia, to connect the motherland with Kaliningrad, after the ceasefire is reached in Ukraine and they've had time to prepare.

        "selftext": "By which I mean, places you should visit ASAP as they may not be as accessible in the future, or even visitable at all. I'll leave some examples below so people get an idea of what I mean. You can speculate, it would be appreciated, obviously we can't know some of these things for certain so you HAVE to speculate but the point is I'd like to visit as many of these time-limited places as I can, and not regret having missed out on some beautiful cultures by having been too late.\n\n#Examples:\n\n__Already passed:__\n\n- Chernobyl Exclusion Zone/Pripyat - can't go there alone without a permit which is not possible for tourists, and tours closed indefinitely since the start of the Ukraine-Russia War [24 Feb 2022, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n- Kyiv, other Ukrainian cities close-ish to the fighting - unlike the above example, which is not visitable at all, places like Kyiv are still visitable for sure but just a bit riskier [24 Feb 2022, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n- Beirut - once called the Paris of the East, this city is now in disarray after constant war, and the massive explosion which plunged the city into further chaos was just the rotten cherry on top. [4 Aug 2020, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n- Israel/Palestine - after 7th October attacks, the region is now not nearly as stable as before, with terror attacks in Tel Aviv just a few days ago as an example. However this region's stability comes and goes like a sin wave, in a few years it should be perfectly safe to visit again. [7 Oct 2023, ALREADY PASSED]\n\n__Likely/certain to happen:__\n\n- Tuvalu - due to climate change and rising sea levels, several of this country's islands are at risk of disappearing [~2050-2100]\n\n- Kiribati - same as above, several islands at risk of being partially/fully submerged. [~2050-2100]\n\n- Maldives - same as above [~2050-2100]\n\n- Marshall Islands - same as above [~2050-2100]\n\n- Glaciers (Switzerland, Glacier National Park in Canada/USA, etc.) - due to climate change, glaciers are getting smaller and smaller, and will eventually disappear. [~2050]\n\n- Coral reefs - if you like scuba diving or snorkelling, coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are eroding away slowly but surely thanks to climate change. [~2060]\n\n- The Baltics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) - the next logical step for Russia, to connect the motherland with Kaliningrad, after the ceasefire is reached in Ukraine and they've had time to prepare. Of course it's not certain, but with the latest happenings in geopolitics and USA decoupling from NATO, it's very much in the realm of possibility that Russia 'test' NATO's resolve and go for this.

It\u2019s all I knew and didn\u2019t know how to adjust in a Covid World.\n\nThe book that helped me the most was The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson.   It was a humorous way for me to start seeing a different perspective on change and adjustment to improve mental health.  I was pretty mad at the world then.  This helped me to laugh at myself and my woes to give a me boost to address it.  \n\nFunny thing is that I noticed other people reading it too at the beach and the coffee shop (in Bali).  Looked like a very popular read for other solo travelers\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\n \n\nI arrive (F23) in Chiang Mai at the end of March for 11 days, and I will need recommendations and criticism regarding my itinerary and the activities I want to do.\n\nMy basic goal was to do Chiang Mai, Pai and Chiang Rai. I would love to do some hikes, but I\u2019m afraid it will be too hot and the farmers will burn their fields when I come to Pai. I think i'm really liking Pai, it\u2019s a quiet city where you can recharge your batteries. But is it a good idea to go there at this time of year?\n\nDo you have any recommendations, or things to avoid?\n\nHow many days do you recommend to stay in Chiang Mai?\n\n\nMy personality : This is my first solo trip, I\u2019m afraid. I am outgoing, I would like to meet people, but I do not want to have special expectations on this subject. I don\u2019t want that to condition the fact that I have a good stay or not. I am sporty, I like nature, animals, food... I am open to everything, but I\u2019m afraid of hurting myself (it would be a shame lol) so I will avoid the big hikes. Also, I don\u2019t like to rush, just spend a day in a city and leave the next day. I prefer to take my time and soak up in the city, although I only have 11 days in Thailand.\n\nPS: I will sleep in a hostel for the duration of my stay; I do not want to drive motorcycles (I do not know how to drive lol I will die)\n\n \n\nThings I want to do :\n\n \n\nChiang Mai :\n\n \n\n-  Walking tour and tuktuk Chiang Mai, visit temples (Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Phra Singh, Wat Lok Moli...)\n\n-  Fah Lanna Spa & Massage | Chiang Mai\n\n-  Muay thai combat\n\n-  Wat Pha Lat (Monk\u2019s Trail) to Doi Suthep\n\n-  Evening hostel\n\n-  Thai cooking class (organic farm)\n\n-  Sunday Night Market Chiang Mai\n\n-  Drag show\n\n-  Lgbt bar? (if i\u2019m not alone), Sapphic Riot, Chiang Mai?\n\n-  Ethic Elephant Sanctuary: ELEPHANT NATURE PARK, Chiang Mai?\n\n-  Wat Phra That Doi Suthep\n\n \n\nPai :\n\n \n\n-  Pai Canyon\n\n-  Wat Phra That Mae Yen\n\n-  White Buddha\n\n-  Pambok waterfall \u2013 Kho Kuu So bamboo bridge loop\n\n-  Visit the city simply\n\n \n\nChiang Rai :\n\n \n\n-  White Temple\n\n-  Hiking around\n\n-  Other things, I haven\u2019t read about this city yet",

The results from Google and Bing were a dismal hodgepodge of review aggregates that did nothing more than identify reviews that mentioned \"breakfast,\" that were then ranked by some combination of number of reviews and star ratings. This was all but useless for finding a really special eatery.\n\nWhile in Chiang Mai, Thailand, I found a reviewer who spent the better part of a year on location there. She was on a mission to find interesting places to visit and dine. Following her personal recommendations, I found a few places that were absolutely delightful.\n\nThis is how we learned about restaurants in the nineteen-hundreds. Sure, maybe the research was done by Harvard backpackers, Bohemian freelancers, or well-heeled seniors, but at least they were trained to write reviews and provided objective information. When damn near every restaurant has a four-star review, it's all but impossible to identify the gems from the crushed glass. (Even more so knowing that some places pay for good reviews.)",

I go to the counter, and am lambasted by the counter agent (I was perfectly calm, she seemed to be having a bad day) until her manager realizes that I'm there on the wrong date and my flight doesn't leave until Sunday night. I sheepishly go back home, and have to wait around all day until 8PM on Sunday, and then head out. \n\nSunday: Wait and Travel\n\nMonday: (AM) This is my first big day and I realize that I haven't packed enough warm clothes for the weather. I'm cold all the time. I have layered up and that seems to be working, but I will probably need to buy a coat at some point. I get on the hop on/hop off bus, and ride around. It's fun, but the cold makes it hard to enjoy. \n\nI also arrived at the hostel and find that the elevator is broken, meaning I have to schlep my luggage three flights. This happens, and it's nobody's fault, but it just made the day kind of worse. \n\n(PM) I go back to the hotel, and only have time to pack for my trip on the train for Tuesday morning, clean up a  little and then rush to the theater for the show I'm seeing. The show was only 'okay', and I got really up close seats (thinking I would treat myself), so I actually couldn't see half the stage. I get back to the hostel, shower (the shower is awful), finish packing and go to bed. \n\nTuesday: (AM) I get up at 5AM for my 6:30 train to Amsterdam. I learn after struggling to stay quiet as I leave the packed hostel dorm that I needed to get up at 4AM and have missed my train. I struggle not to cry while paying the difference for a new ticket, go back to the hostel and wait around in the lobby. I am still cold. \n\n(PM) I've been on the train most of the day, and took a nap (which helped because I was exhausted), but I wanted to be in Amsterdam earlier because I am only here overnight to visit friends. \n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice on how to enjoy the rest of this trip. It's only Tuesday and I feel like I want to go home so badly. This is very different from my trip to Argentina last year, and my many trips to China and previously to the Netherland where I traveled solo and had a great time. I'm just wondering what's the best way to push pass this kind of bad experience and get myself in the right headspace. It seems like everything has gone wrong, and I'm struggling to stay positive.",

I've not done any solo travel before so not really sure of how easy it will be to meet people to travel with etc. \n\nI've seen lots of companies offering pre-booked tours, but these seem to be mostly aimed at older travellers. It also seems like many people just meet people in Kathmandu and agree to trek together that way. \n\nSo how easy is it to find people to trek with in Kathmandu? And is it easy to book last minute guides? I'd be staying there in a hostel for 2-3 days before trekking, so would have that as an opportunity to meet people there. \n\nAlternatively are there any tour operators that anyone can reccommend who cater to mostly young people (say under 35s)? Since I'd rather be travelling with people who are close in age as it would be easier to find common interests and get along with them. ",

Because of the war, i will be going south and entering europe through turkey. WIlling to spend at least a month in russia.\n\nGeorgia; Azerbaijan and Turkey: continue to exploraring, maybe cycling a bit and hiking, depending on the safety. In turkey i wish to spend at least 5 days in istambul. \n\nBalkans: the part of the trip im mostly looking foward to, willing to spend a long time exploring most aspects of it, former yugoslavian culture, nature, food.

However, I\u2019m worried I will feel as if I went all the way to Asia and didn\u2019t make the most of it by seeing as much as possible. \n\nHas anyone ever had a similar experience while traveling and if so walk me through your thought process. Any other relevant insight is welcome as well. \n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm (33M) planning a trip to Cambodia for a couple weeks in July.  I'm a fairly seasoned solo traveler and backpacker, but I haven't done too much travelling since Covid.  So I'm excited to get back out on my first real solo trip since then.  I plan on focusing my trip around history, nature, food, and maybe some light partying, but I'm definitely starting to age out of the partying part.  I plan on staying in private rooms in hostels so I can easily meet other travelers while still getting comfort and privacy when I need it.  \n\nI know July is the rainy season in Cambodia, and I'm wondering how rainy it actually is.  Is this trip still worth doing that time of year?  I've read that it mostly just monsoons that last for an hour or so in the afternoons. I live in Phoenix, so I'm familiar with them and the chaos that monsoons bring.  \n\nItinerary\n\n7/4 - Arrive Phnom Penh  \nHostel - Onedrez  \nThe flight I'm looking at lands at 10pm so I'll probably just head to the hostel and go to bed.  \n\n7/5 - Phnom Penh  \nHostel - Onedrez  \nDuring the day do S21 and the Killing Field, and in the evening hang out at the hostel and go to a night market for dinner.  I was considering doing Phnom Penh at the end of the trip but my primary interests there are the Khmer Rouge related attractions and I don't want to end on a depressing note.  I'm assuming the emotions will be similar to visiting Dachau or other Holocaust related sites\n\n7/6 - Flight to Siem Reap  \nHostel -  Lub d  \nI try to minimize activities on travel days since they can be unpredictable.  I plan on just checking in to my hostel and then finding a motorbike to rent for my time in Siem Reap.  I heard you can buy the Tickets for Angkor Wat the afternoon before, so I'll probably do that to beat the lines.    \n\n7/7 - 7/9 - Siem Reap   \nHostel -  Lub d  \nI plan on spending most of my time motorbiking around Angkor Wat and the other temples.  I'll would like to find a tour of Angkor Wat itself so I can learn the history of it.  Am I able to just show up and find a tour guide?  I saw there is a landmine museum here so I'll check that out one day.  \n\n7/10 - Boat to Battambang  \nHostel - The Place  \nI read that there is a boat from Siem Reap to Battambang.  I thought that looks like a interesting was to get there.  I'm also debating just driving a motorbike there my self, but I'm leaning towards a boat at the moment.  \n\n7/11 - Battambang  \nHostel - The Place  \nI've read that Battambang can give you a more authentic taste of Cambodia since its slightly off the main beaten path.  I plan on doing the Bamboo Train, crocodile farm, and Bat cave.  I'm going to rent a motorbike to get around.  \n\n7/12 - Journey to Koh Rong  \nHostel - The Lost Boys  \nThis will be far be the most complicated travel day, so any advise on how to do this will be welcomed.  It looks like there is an 11:30am flight from Siem Reap to Sihanoukville.  I think this is my best option.  My current plan is to get a taxi or shell out the cash and hire a private driver to get me to the airport.  It seem to be about a 3 hour drive to the airport so I'll need to be on the road by 6am for this to work.  I don't know how easy it will be to find a taxi this early in the morning so a private driver may be the better option.  Once I manage to get to Sihanoukville, get a Grab to the pier and a ferry to Koh Rong.  \n\n7/13 -7/15 - Koh Rong  \nHostel - The Lost Boys  \nI plan on just exploring the Island just relaxing on the beaches.  I'll probably try to go SCUBA diving, I already have a PADI Advanced Open Water certification.  One of the days I might head over to Koh Rong Sanloem and check that island out.  \n\n7/16 - Bus to Kampot  \nHostel - Karma Traders  \nI'll probably get the first ferry out of Koh Rong in the morning.  Once I get to the hostel I'll find a motorbike and explore the town and hit up a night market for dinner.   \n\n7/17 - 7/18 - Kampot  \nHostel - Karma Traders  \nOne of the days I plan on motorbiking around Bokor National Park and looking the the French Ruins.  I also plan on going in to Kep and checking out the crab market, I don't know if that will be the same day or not.  I will try to kayak one day on the river.  I may do the Kampot pepper farm tour if there is time, but that's not a must do for me.  \n\n7/19 - Head back to the 120F desert I call home  \nI think getting a early morning bus makes the most sense.  The flight I'm looking at leaves at 11:30pm so I should be good on time even with the unreliable transportation.  If I end up having time I might find a market to checkout.  \n\n7/20 - Bonus day in Seoul  \nThe flight I'm looking at has an eleven hour layover in Inchon and lands at 7am.  I'm thinking I'll head in Seoul for the day.  I don't really know what I'm going to do so I'm open to suggestions\n\nHow does this itinerary look? Am I missing anything that a must see or do?  Also, if anyone as suggestions for restaurants or anything, I'd love the hear them.  ",

I\u2019m currently looking at booking two separate buses with Giant Ibis: overnight from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh (10pm-4am) and then Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh (8am-2:30pm). It seems most other overnight buses have a change over in Phnom Penh anyway, and the Giant Ibis buses are one of the few I\u2019ve found that have a washroom on board (a priority for me). \n\nHowever, looking at various forums, I\u2019m now worried about the safety of the buses. I\u2019ve chosen Giant Ibis because they\u2019ve got a lot of good reviews and seem to be a reputable company, but safety on the road is still a concern. I don\u2019t know what company to pick for the overnight from Bangkok to Siem Reap either, because there are a few options but not many reviews. \n\nFinally, I\u2019m also not sure if 2 days is enough. I\u2019d arrive at around 10am and drop off my bag somewhere, maybe have lunch, so I\u2019d have the full afternoon, then the whole day after. Since I\u2019m adding so much travel time, should I consider adding an extra day? Honestly don\u2019t know much about Cambodia, not familiar with its history or culture, just want to see the temples, but open to exploring a little more in Siem Reap. ",

(Though I am banking on my problem stemming from everything)\n\nFortunately for myself I didn't pack my itinerary and really only had a couple things I wanted to see in each city I am staying in but am hitting a bit of a wall with even wanting to leave my hotel. \n\nI know I need to just get up and go outside and I'm sure that would help leagues more than staying in but\nAny advice on what I can do to ease up this burnout and help to maybe get a bit more motivation in my system is greatly appreciated!!\n\nEdit: Something else I think maybe something is the elevation change.

I really enjoy museums and exploring historical sites, finding a nice wine bar and reading a book. But I also love snorkeling and some easy surfing.

I'll be staying there for 2 weeks. My interests are hiking and seeing the natural beauty of Taiwan so I don't want to spend too much time in Taipei. After some initial itinerary planning this is where I'm at. Please tell me if this is feasible and what changes I should make to improve it. Also, is it better to bring a 40L backpack or a small suitcase and a small backpack for day hikes? Other notes: I'm pescatarian (vegetarian+fish), budget is flexible, thinking about 1000 USD (33000 NTD) for 2 weeks with stays at comfortable hostels or basic hotels, can go higher for unique experiences. For the hikes so far I've been thinking of doing them solo if I can get permits as needed for some but is it recommended to go with some guide or a group?\n\nDays 1-3: Taipei\n\nBase in Taipei for three days and take day trips.\n\nHikes:\nElephant Mountain for Taipei skyline views.\nQixing Mountain (Taipei\u2019s highest peak).\nJinbaoli Trail.\nShakadang Historic Trail in Yangmingshan.\n\nExplore Taipei: Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Longshan Temple, Shilin Night Market\n\nDays 4-8: Hehuanshan & Cingjing Farm\n\nTravel to Cingjing Farm, stay for four nights.\n\nHikes:\nHehuan North, Main, and East Peaks.\nShimen Mountain.\nCingjing Skywalk & Green Green Grasslands.\n\nDays 9-14: Alishan & Yushan National Park\n\nBase in Alishan for six nights.\n\nHikes:\nYushan (Jade Mountain) Main Peak (two-day permit trek).\nFenqihu to Dadongshan Trail.\nAlishan Giant Tree Trail & Xiaoliyuanshan Sunrise Trail.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! Am in a bit of an interesting situation and was curious if this has happened to anyone else? I'm (30F) about to go off solo travelling to Vietnam at the end of February and applied for a Vietnamese eVisa earlier this week as a Canadian citizen. I initially tried to pay with my AmEx and the payment didn't go through (as I've heard this is common) and made a new application with my Visa which went through fine.\n\nI called AmEx to ensure the charge didn't go through prior to making my second application with the Visa and they assured me the charge has been blocked and wouldn't be cleared. This morning I woke up and saw I was accepted for two eVisas - apparently the AmEx charge did go through later, and the one with the Visa went through as I had seen.\n\nMy question is- has anyone had this issue before? I don't see any immediate concerns with having the two eVisas and will just use the same one to enter/exit the country, but wasn't sure if there would be a problem with two visas tied to the same passport. I may be overthinking the problem but just wanted to be sure!\n\nI'll dispute the charge with AmEx when I'm all safe and back from Vietnam. In any case, thanks for any advice/help in advance!",

I think someone who backpacks multiple countries at once might be able to answer this.\nFrom my understanding, a lot of countries require you to have a flight in and out of the country in order to get a visa. However, what if you don\u2019t know when you are going to leave?\n\nIs it best to book a refundable round trip, and just cancel the return flight when you get there? Then when ready to leave book a one way flight home?\n\nOr should I book a cheap flight to a neighboring country that I just eat the cost of and never take?\n\nI\u2019m planning on going to Thailand in April, with no real end date. Will probably be about 3-5 weeks.\n\nEdit: just for clarification, I\u2019m realizing that it\u2019s not necessarily for visa, but for access to the airline and to avoid risk of getting turned away at the gate.

I planned it all pretty last minute (in fact I still have to book some flights for the last leg), and honestly I was hoping to find a friend to go with, but no one was available since most of my friends graduate in April, or are already working.\n\n***Reviewing my Trip so Far***\n\nI'm currently on day 20 of my 34-day trip. So far I've done Vietnam, Thailand, and now just finished a 10-day trek in Nepal. I absolutely loved my week in Vietnam, although it helped that I was visiting a friend who lived there. The weather was incredible (it was -15C when I left Toronto), and the streets just felt so alive, food was delicious and cheap, and there was coffee and fruit smoothies on every corner. People were also extremely friendly and I felt completely safe the whole time. I was only in Thailand for a couple days so can't really give honest feedback, but I enjoyed Wat Arun, and I was still very full of excitement for the trip. Trekking in Nepal was a whole experience. I went in without much research, and luckily chose a good guide. Saw absolutely incredible mountain views, struggled against high altitude (up to 5000m), and experienced the local Tibetan/Tamang/Himalayan culture which was totally unique to me. The hygiene situation was an eye-opener for me, and required a lot of open-mindedness and courage on my part (outdoor squat toilets, bucket showers, no soap, re-using all clothing).\n\nBut trekking in Nepal also had brought a lot of negative emotions - I went during the off-season, so the villages were nearly empty, and I met very few other tourists along the way. During the non-trekking hours, I was gripped by crushing loneliness and FOMO - thinking about what all my friends at home were doing, whether there was anyone I could even reach out to, and worrying about how I didn't have much of a life to return to at home. Wi-Fi was also very spotty and infrequent. It doesn't help that this was a huge life transition period for me - leaving behind my uni friends and moving back to my home city, with little community and no job lined up. Journalling helped a bit, and I've also been vlogging my experience (although I haven't had a chance to edit anything together yet). By the end of the trek, I couldn't fully enjoy the experience since I was counting down the days until I could leave.\n\n***Current struggle with lonliness, anxiety and burnout***\n\nI just got back from the trek, and still have a few days in Kathmandu before I fly out to Thailand. My head is kind of spinning, and I can't seem to catch my breath, even though the air here is 50% higher than what I'm adjusted to. I still need to decide my itinerary for the rest of the trip, and book tickets and accomodations.\n\nThe problem is, I don't know how I can enjoy the rest of my trip when I just feel so lonely, overwhelmed, and scared of regretting spending all this time and money. I really wish I had someone to experience this whole trip with - and it hurts and makes me feel inadequate knowing that I don't have such a person in my life.\n\nI also can't believe my trip is already 60% over. I really want to make the most of this trip and remember it with no regrets. But I already sort of regret having spent so much of this trip feeling lonely in Nepal.\n\n***Suggestions for planning the last leg of the trip?***\n\nMy plan for the last leg of this trip is flying from Nepal to Thailand, spending a few days in Bangkok hopefully at a hostel, then taking a sleeper train + high-speed rail to Laos (specifically Luang Prabang), then ending the trip in Japan.\n\nI'm hoping that staying in hostels will help with the loneliness by giving me an opportunity to meet other travellers. I'm a bit shy/introverted by nature but I have no problems making friends as long as there's a space specifically for people to meet. Speaking of, does anyone have any recommendations for hostels in Bangkok or Luang Prabang that are good for meeting friends to hang out with and do day trips with? I'm not a party person, just looking for people to chill with, go to restaurants, and hopefully do day trips.\n\nI would also appreciate any advice in general about coping with feelings of loneliness and anxiety, and how to prevent it from ruining your solo trip.\n\nThank you!",

As a solo traveler, I mostly stay in hostels, especially party hostels, to meet people. However, I\u2019ve noticed that the vast majority of travelers I meet are between 18-24 years old. Out of around 50-60 people I\u2019ve talked to, only 2-3 were my age or older.\n\nWhile I do enjoy meeting new people, I\u2019ve realized there\u2019s often a disconnect between me and this younger crowd. Our conversations tend to hit a wall at some point\u2014our lifestyles, experiences, and interests differ significantly. This also extends to romantic connections. I\u2019m single and open to travel romances, but most of the women I meet are at least 3-4 years younger, sometimes even 9-10 years younger. I\u2019ve noticed that once they learn my age, their interest often fades.\n\nI know I could afford to stay in nicer hostels or even hotels, but from what I\u2019ve seen, those tend to attract couples or much older travelers (often retirees), making it harder to meet like-minded solo travelers. So far, all my connections have been quite surface-level, and I\u2019d really love to meet:\n\n\t1.\tFellow travelers around my age (late 20s \u2013 early 30s) who share a similar mindset.\n\n\t2.\tWomen with whom I could potentially form a romantic connection either for a short-time or longer.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Any advice on meeting travelers in their late 20s/early 30s? I\u2019m enjoying my time-off in SEA but I would really meet like-minded people that close to my age\u2026",

I'm new to this whole thing really so experiencing a whole lot of interesting thoughts and ideas.\n\nI just wanted to talk about kinda a clich\u00e8 that I've been feeling on this trip, but the highs are real high and they are often (for me) followed by some low feelings. Often ill have days at the moment where I doubt myself for making the choices I did to leave everything behind and come out here on this aimless journey. I'll compare myself to my peers who are all buying houses and having serious relationships, and I'm over here sometimes feeling lost. Let me know if anyone else has felt this feeling too.\n\nI do love the trip in many ways but these feelings exist in me and I wanted to express them to anyone that wants to listen\n\nFor me I don't have a return date in mind, just on the road while there is money in my pocket and I'm feeling like being here. \n\nPeace and seeya space cowboy.",

I have never travelled alone, but have been to all inclusive resorts many times with others and I have loved them. I am thinking Mexico this time around. \n\nThe issue lies in the fact that I am worried I may begin to feel a sense of loneliness or displacement. While I certainly love my alone time, chilling on the beach, eating good food, and taking time for myself, I feel like the majority of the people there will be surrounded by others which could make me feel isolated. I recently broke up with my girlfriend as well, and we had an absolutely amazing trip this time last year at an all inclusive together. \n\nDoes anyone have any solo experiences at any all inclusive resorts? Did the time for yourself suffice for the fact that you were alone? \n\n",

The airline's system listed my first name as \"FNU\" and my entire name, \"Muhammad Abdul Rauf Bin Che Jalil,\" under the surname. When I contacted Etihad to verify this, they explained that, based on the MRZ code in Malaysian passports, we technically don\u2019t have a first name. As a result, Etihad follows a standard procedure by inputting names this way.\n\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with this format, as Malaysia Airlines handles name bookings differently. To be honest, I'm feeling quite anxious. Will the staff at KLIA recognize this format? Will I still be allowed to board at the gate?

Thinking Zagreb for a couple of days, then Split, Krka National Park and maybe Hvar.\n\nAfter that go Bosnia, couple of days in Mostar and probably a few days in Sarajevo. I reckon I'll really get into the history here.\n\nThen I'm not too sure whether to go East to Belgrade and Sofia or South to Tirana and then Greece. I have a friend who lives in Athens so maybe go South and see them. Maybe do a bit of island hopping.\n\nIs 2 months too long for what I've planned? Should I maybe get another Workaway here somewhere?\n\n  \n**August + September - T\u00fcrkiye**\n\nI went to spend a fair bit of time in Istanbul and T\u00fcrkiye in general. There is some cool Workaways around Istanbul but I'm not sure if that would be better in August or September.\n\nDebating going to Ankara or maybe Izmir before heading to Antalya but then I have to head back to Istanbul for my flight.\n\n**End of September/Start of October onwards - SEA**\n\nHere on wards my plans are very thing but I feel like SEA plans should be quite open and i'll have plenty of time during my initial journey months to figure it out.\n\nI will be flying from Istanbul to Hanoi (although the flights are quite expensive $500). In Vietnam I definitely want to see Hang P\u00e1c B\u00f3 and do the H\u00e0 Giang. I've been riding motorbikes for years and I would really love to drive down the coast from Haiphong to Ho Chi Minh City. **btw, how do motorbike rentals work in Vietnam? Would i be better of just buying one?** This is all on the assumption that I can get a 90 day visa as i dont think I'd be able to do all this on a 30 day visa.\n\nThen I want to cross over land into Cambodia into Phnom Penh, Krong Siem Reap and north into Loas.\n\nLast I want to spend quite a bit of time in Thailand. Cross into Chiang Rai/Chiang Mai and chill for a bit. Maybe do some Muay Thai like every other stereotypical white boy. Then travel down to Bangkok and maybe Pattaya.\n\n**After SEA**\n\nThis will vary massively on how much money I have left. As a Europoor, it almost feels like a shame to go so far east without stopping by South Korea and Japan but I bet it's expensive.\n\nI'm also debating going to India on the way back to Europe but I've heard a lot of horror stories and honestly it just seems really intense.",

        "selftext": "Hey all.   \n\nLooking for a little input from others.   \n\nI'm heading to Indonesia in a couple weeks to do some volunteering in Jakarta and Bandung.    I have a free weekend in between and I'll take an extra 4 days after I'm done for R&R\n\nI'm in Bandung first, so I figured I'd take the train to Yogyakarta for the weekend, then fly back to Jakarta.  \n\nAt the end, I have 4 nights free before needing to head back to Jakarta.    Indonesia obviously has many many options and I'd love to do them all, but with 4 nights and limited funds, I figured the easiest thing is to experience Bali.  \n\nI know it's not the Bali of old.  It's overrun by tourists, but it still feels like a place to experience at least once to me.  \n\nMy thought is, 2 nights in Ubud and then 2 nights in Nusa Lembongan to get some ocean air.   \n\nDoes that seem feasible? Better suggestions? ",

Then could divide that by the weeks for my budget; being around $500 a week \n\nBut now I\u2019m worried about budget, I started out with between 25-30k AUD prior to making some bookings (unsure of exact), then left with 24k, I currently have 22k as of 3.5 weeks in Thailand \n\n\nJordan bookings ect will cost me around $500 (rest of the accommodation, Jordan pass and wadi rum tour)\n\nItaly I think will cost me around 2k for 6 weeks, I checked everything and it\u2019s around 1200-1400 for accommodation, 400-600 for transport, and around 200 for what I wanna do / see that I know of. plus whatever else so around 2.5-3k\n\nI probably have another 1k worth of expenses left in Thailand \n\nAdmittedly, for me Thailand is expensive and around 1-1.5k for activities as there is a lot that is interesting to me here eg. $300 sak yant, $200 Muay Thai training, $200 for 4x fight shows, $150 fishing park then around 100ish for temples. I don\u2019t engage in the normal tourist activities and stuff (atvs, ect)\n\nWhereas in Jordan and Italy, I don\u2019t have much booked nor interested in. I\u2019m more keen to just explore the country, hike and walk ect \n\nObviously that still leaves me with a pretty significant amount of money, and divided up between the duration I have booked I could live pretty lavish, but I\u2019m looking to do this for as long and see as much as possible without feeling stressed about money or missing out. At the same time, I don\u2019t know how far to plan or book in advance as I don\u2019t wanna shoot myself in the foot as even it\u2019s surprised me that I\u2019ve spent 1.5-2k so far. when I break it down I can only pinpoint a few areas where I may have been abit stupid, eg first two weeks I ate out spending $300 but also did groceries with it making around $500 total. The rest has just been random costs like $20 for headlice treatment or a new eSIM. It just shocks me because I\u2019m normally pretty aware of my spending and also haven\u2019t done all that much \n\nso far I haven\u2019t missed out but the budgeting has been stressful, and I feel like it\u2019s ruining my trip. the anxiety of it makes me not want to do anything at all and I definitely am wasting my days away here on Koh Chang when I could be at least wasting away on the beach stress free\n\nI\u2019ve tried to / considered totally changing my plan, to spending more time in cheap countries and doing; Spain, Portugal, Morocco, a small 2-3 week stint around England / France and Belgium and the Netherlands, Egypt, Montenegro,  Greece, turkey and then Georgia & Armenia; and then either heading home, to the states to work away or making my way back across through India / Nepal and SEA before going home.\n\nRight now, I just feel massively overwhelmed. I have more than enough money, but for how long of a duration I\u2019m not sure and that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying me. \n\nThe countries I want to visit are cheap (or expensive ones I want to spend a shorter amount of time), I\u2019m keen on hostels, don\u2019t eat out (admittedly this was more of a binge when I did) and am just keen to see heaps .\n\nDo I shorten my trip and stay longer or do more activities in more expensive places or cheaper ones? Do I focus on the cheaper ones, and spend the time in expensive places shorter? Do I plan far ahead? Do I budget a weekly or daily? (It\u2019s hard when I don\u2019t know how much to divide my money by and don\u2019t have everything booked) Do I just roll on the fly? Staying aware of how much I spend but spend when I want to do something and when I get low, call it and go home? Booking in advance is always cheaper, but I also have just spend almost three days staring at a screen trying to figure out a plan and all the costs just to get no where, while I waste my time. \n\nRight now, even a part of me wants to call it and go home while I still have all the money I worked so hard for in my account still. \n\nI know this post is a mess, but any input or advice is welcome. \n\nThanks \n\n\n\n",

It just shocks me because I\u2019m normally pretty aware of my spending and also haven\u2019t done all that much \n\nso far I haven\u2019t missed out but the budgeting has been stressful, and I feel like it\u2019s ruining my trip. the anxiety of it makes me not want to do anything at all and I definitely am wasting my days away here on Koh Chang when I could be at least wasting away on the beach stress free\n\nI\u2019ve tried to / considered totally changing my plan, to spending more time in cheap countries and doing; Spain, Portugal, Morocco, a small 2-3 week stint around England / France and Belgium and the Netherlands, Egypt, Montenegro,  Greece, turkey and then Georgia & Armenia; and then either heading home, to the states to work away or making my way back across through India / Nepal and SEA before going home.\n\nRight now, I just feel massively overwhelmed. I have more than enough money, but for how long of a duration I\u2019m not sure and that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying me. \n\nThe countries I want to visit are cheap (or expensive ones I want to spend a shorter amount of time), I\u2019m keen on hostels, don\u2019t eat out (admittedly this was more of a binge when I did) and am just keen to see heaps .\n\nDo I shorten my trip and stay longer or do more activities in more expensive places or cheaper ones? Do I focus on the cheaper ones, and spend the time in expensive places shorter? Do I plan far ahead? Do I budget a weekly or daily? (It\u2019s hard when I don\u2019t know how much to divide my money by and don\u2019t have everything booked) Do I just roll on the fly? Staying aware of how much I spend but spend when I want to do something and when I get low, call it and go home? Booking in advance is always cheaper, but I also have just spend almost three days staring at a screen trying to figure out a plan and all the costs just to get no where, while I waste my time. \n\nRight now, even a part of me wants to call it and go home while I still have all the money I worked so hard for in my account still. \n\nI know this post is a mess, but any input or advice is welcome. \n\nThanks \n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nI'm planning to solo travel to Thailand for 2-3 weeks and am pretty flexible on timing. I'm trying to figure out where the best places to visit are. I'm mostly interested in seeing nature and local culture (I'm Asian and am interested in exploring real different Asian cultures, not partying with tourists). I'm not into drinking or partying or anything like that but ideally it'd be nice to meet some people along the way. From the research I've done it seems like the North is better for what I'm looking for so would appreciate any specific recommendations about what to do/where to stay there. Also, I love beaches and swimming but again am trying to avoid party scenes if anyone has any recommendations for that as well. Obviously looking to stay in safe areas. Budget is pretty open as well. \n\nThank you! ",

Do you guys have some recommendations to not spend most of budget at these stays?   \nI'm also questioning myself how it looks like with other solo travellers and parties at my stays cuz as I read China/HK/Taiwan isn't the most famous solo travel route.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "I'm looking to go travelling. I've already been to a lot of countries in Western Europe. Right now I'm looking at a holiday in the Balkans. No solid plans yet but I think Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Turkey are maybe what interests me the most. What really appeals to me about these is that they are countries I know so little about. They seem quite exotic to me. They also seem like it'll be a change in architecture, people and cultures from what I am used to. I think countries like Bosnia which has a fusion of muslim and your more standard european architecture really interests me.\n\nI think my other options would be central Europe i.e Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechia and Poland. These also interest me but not as much. I think the main things that are making me reconsider the Balkans is that they are not as well known for tourism, so they might not have as much to do that's interesting as the previous ones. They might also be more difficult to travel as they are not so tourist centred.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Am I crazy for wanting to do this? Also what I'm interested is history, seeing cool stuff, learning about culture and trying interesting foods",

The perfect size to explore on foot, along with everyone else - this is a place where everyone walks, except for all the scooter tramps. You either have a scooter or you look out for them coming at you! Overall very pedestrian-friendly and friendly in general. English is widely-spoken and acceptable as an opening. Very calm and quiet for such a busy town. A lot of economic activity despite being the off-season, the only obvious tourists are Russians, loud and demanding. Otherwise, plenty of expats and probable nomads. A long, gorgeous promenade runs along the busy harbor which hosts yachts and boats of all kinds. Hundreds of shops and restaurants of all kinds and all price ranges. Quite upscale and obviously a prosperous place. Nowhere near the sensory overload of Istanbul, with very few shopkeepers touting out in front of their shops. Very orderly and clean streets for the most part, although cigarette butts are a constant street presence.\n\nI'm here for two months and have an Airbnb two blocks from the harbor for about $1,000/month. Being such a popular spot, Bodrum is more expensive than many other places in Turkey and quite a few shops and hotels shut down for the winter, which means less to choose from during the off-season. My place is roomy, has a full kitchen and is safe and quiet. The town feels very safe and people of all ages walk around at all hours. No beggars or visible homeless population. A vibrant place even in Winter, with loads of pedestrians and a very lively social scene, with bars, cafes and nighttime hotspots for everyone. Plenty of local historical sites and charming old neighborhoods to explore. A huge local marketplace has vendors of all kinds throughout the week. All in all, a fabulous place to hang your hat for a spell!\n\nFeel free to AMA.\n\n",

        "selftext": "Unfortunately due to circumstance and my company being generally not that accommodating to extend my flights longer and using personal vacation days. I've visited Taipei / Taichung area twice now but have not had much time to explore outside of a couple days around Taipei and did some of the more commonly recommended places in Taipei already.\n\nThis time I have around 3-4 days to give a proper exploration of Taiwan and this is the general itinerary I've planned but open to changing if it seems to unreasonable.\n\n**Day 1 (Thursday):** Finishing my work day next Thursday in Taichung late afternoon and take the and will likely take the HSR to Zuoying. Have a hotel near Liouhe Market / Sanfong and do some mild exploration before calling it a night.\n\n**Day 2 (Friday) :** Make my way over early to Donggang to take a Ferry to Xiaoliuqiu. Spend the day doing a snorkeling tour on Klook and just generally spend the day exploring the island / catching sunset.\n\n**Day 3 (Saturday):** Make my way back to Donggang and go towards Alishan.\n\n* Xiaoliuqiu --> Donggang (30 mins)\n\n* Donggang --> Zuoying HSR (\\~1hr)\n\n* Zuoying HSR --> Chiayi HSR (\\~30 min)\n\n* Chiayi --> bus towards Alishan as Forest Railway is sold out (2.5 hrs)\n\n* \u00a0\n\n   * The latest bus is at 14:10 so this is my biggest concern in my itinerary, that if I aim for this single bus; there will be no space or it'll be tight on my timeline it might ruin the trip\n\n   * I also hear to buy tickets for the Zhushan line only opens until 4:30PM at Alishan train station so I may arrive after that time?\n\nAssuming I make it to Alishan. I would likely just get some food and call it an early night for the next morning.\n\n**Day 4 (Sunday):** Take the early morning train for classic sunrise at Zhushan. Walk my way down and enjoy some tea, etc. before taking a bus back to Chiayi. Maybe exploring the town a little bit or just going straight back to Taoyuan.\n\n  \nFlight is at 23:55PM so I have lots of time to kill before making my way back to Taoyuan and flying back home.\n\n  \nIs my itinerary reasonable? My biggest concern without a doubt is the logistics to Alishan. Getting to Xiaoliuqiu seems pretty simple but Alishan logsitics seems like a bit of a nightmare / stressful especially since you can't pre-book.\n\nI haven't booked anything so I can always deviate and\n\ndo something like:\n\n**Thursday:** Taichung --> Chiayi\n\n**Friday:** Chiayi --> Alishan\n\n**Saturday:** Alishan --> Chiayi --> Zuoying/Kaohsiung area\n\n**Sunday:** Day trip to Xiaoliuqiu and return my way back to Taoyuan.\n\n  \nLet me know what you guys think based on experience and any specific beta that you all might have done to make it easier.\n\n  \nThanks!",

I spent the last two nights in a Mad Monkey and it wasn\u2019t even that bad but for some reason the people in this \u201cchill hostel\u201d are turning on all the lights and slamming doors at quiet hours. Perhaps I\u2019m just annoyed that there\u2019s no curtains here. \n\nMaybe my excursion tomorrow will help lighten my mood.

I\u2019m thinking of going for around a month and was looking at the Annapurna Circuit, Annapurna Sanctuary, or Everest Base Camp, but the options are so overwhelming I can\u2019t choose!\n\nI\u2019d love to go on a trek where I can experience Nepali culture and Hinduism/Buddhism while still getting the dramatic Himalayas views and being right in the mountains.\n\nMy concerns are: \n\nEBC seems good because it\u2019s just so iconic, but is it worth putting up with how touristy it is?\n\nDo you get as much of a feel for culture and religion on the Annapurna Sanctuary track as the Circuit? \n\nWould it be feasible to do 2 treks in the one month? \n\n\n\nAlternate suggestions or more info on these treks would be much appreciated!

        "selftext": "Solo travel isn't much of a thing where I'm from. I'm 29 and have only done 4 solo trips, 3 domestic and 1 abroad. I was born into a lower income family in a poor country so it took me until last November when I finally got myself a trip abroad for the first time, even if only for 9 days.\n\nI'm a bit of a loner, although I have friends. Financially I'm doing okay, not brilliant not terrible. I have dated a bit, not really enjoyed it. Never spoken to anyone longer than 2 months, I guess. \n\nI had a decent enough time in Thailand, meeting fairly interesting people from over 20 countries without going drinking/clubbing. Yet on occasion I felt a bit lonely, especially as it was my longest trip yet. My Mom was irked I didn't get more photos of myself as she thinks it's a big deal for her son to go abroad. I mean I do recall going to school aged 8 being force fed rice and ketchup but lol. I don't like photographing myself that much, though I do care about looking pretty. \n\nI have a decent job and can afford at least one solo trip abroad a year. My parents don't have passports though I guess we can get theirs made this year. I prefer traveling solo though I've not taken trips with parents in years (maybe since I was like .. 12?). I'm close to my Mom, my Dad just sorta exists. \n\nI hardly met anyone who was on a shorter trip in Thailand than myself, and a good few of them (mostly Europeans) were traveling solo. I only stayed in a hostel the last 2 days, had I known they'd be as clean as mine was, I'd have steered clear of hotels throughout as it wasn't all that lonely in the hostel. \n\nSorry for my rambling and thanks if you could make it this far. So how do you combat loneliness when traveling solo? Thanks. Have a good week. ",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am planning on making a trip to Vietnam next month. I have my plane ticket booked, just no accommodations yet (tell me if I'm being stupid waiting this long to book my accommodations and tours).\n\nI am leaving Canada for a 10 day trip to Vietnam and then a 10 day trip to the Philippines. I've been to the Philippines before so I'm not that stressed on a stricter itinerary, but Vietnam I'm not as sure.\n\nI will just be bringing a 40L backpack. Undecided if I will be bringing a day pack as well.\n\nI am excluding the Ha Giang Loop for another trip for when I get more time and hopefully Canada gets on the International Drivers License list.\n\n**Here is my plan so far, some of my concerns are:**\n\n1. Should I stay an extra day in Ninh Binh?\n2.  Am I staying too long in Sapa?\n3.  Will I need more than 40L backpack, should I bring a daypack with me especially during a trek tour?\n4.  Is 3 days in Hoi An/Da Nang too much? Could I potentially do a day-trip to Phong Nha for a cave tour?\n\n**Day 1** \\- ***Hanoi*** \\- Landing early morning in Hanoi.\n\n* I am planning on pre-booking a hotel for the day before so I can check in and put store my bags and refresh a bit.\n\n**Day 2** \\- ***Hanoi***\n\n* Explore more of Hanoi - I haven't decided my exact itinerary in Hanoi, I'm planning on making a loose itinerary of things I want to see and just doing what I feel like that day.\n\n**Day 3** \\- Depart ***Hanoi*** in the morning for ***Ninh Binh***.\n\n* Planning to do Trang An boat tour and Mua Cave sunset hike\n\n**Day 4** \\- Stay in ***Ninh Binh*** until evening then take an overnight train to ***Sapa.***\n\n* Planning on exploring without a tour by renting a bike and possibly see some Pagodas or other landmarks.\n* I originally wanted to stay 2 nights in Ninh Binh but thought it would be more efficient to take the overnight train to Sapa (from Hanoi).

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am planning on making a trip to Vietnam next month. I have my plane ticket booked, just no accommodations yet (tell me if I'm being stupid waiting this long to book my accommodations and tours).\n\nI am leaving Canada for a 10 day trip to Vietnam and then a 10 day trip to the Philippines. I've been to the Philippines before so I'm not that stressed on a stricter itinerary, but Vietnam I'm not as sure.\n\nI will just be bringing a 40L backpack. Undecided if I will be bringing a day pack as well.\n\nI am excluding the Ha Giang Loop for another trip for when I get more time and hopefully Canada gets on the International Drivers License list.\n\n**Here is my plan so far, some of my concerns are:**\n\n1. Should I stay an extra day in Ninh Binh?\n2.  Am I staying too long in Sapa?\n3.  Will I need more than 40L backpack, should I bring a daypack with me especially during a trek tour?\n4.  Is 3 days in Hoi An/Da Nang too much? Could I potentially do a day-trip to Phong Nha for a cave tour?\n\n**Day 1** \\- ***Hanoi*** \\- Landing early morning in Hanoi.\n\n* I am planning on pre-booking a hotel for the day before so I can check in and put store my bags and refresh a bit.\n\n**Day 2** \\- ***Hanoi***\n\n* Explore more of Hanoi - I haven't decided my exact itinerary in Hanoi, I'm planning on making a loose itinerary of things I want to see and just doing what I feel like that day.\n\n**Day 3** \\- Depart ***Hanoi*** in the morning for ***Ninh Binh***.\n\n* Planning to do Trang An boat tour and Mua Cave sunset hike\n\n**Day 4** \\- Stay in ***Ninh Binh*** until evening then take an overnight train to ***Sapa.***\n\n* Planning on exploring without a tour by renting a bike and possibly see some Pagodas or other landmarks.\n* I originally wanted to stay 2 nights in Ninh Binh but thought it would be more efficient to take the overnight train to Sapa (from Hanoi). Please let me know your thoughts on this!'\n\n**Day 5** \\- Arrive in ***Sapa*** in the morning.\n\n* I want to do a 2D1N Hiking tour. Do I need to prebook this or can I just book once I arrive in Sapa? I was thinking doing the Sapa Sisters tour.\n\n**Day 6** \\- Overnight in ***Sapa*** with the tour\n\n* Get dropped off in Sapa town assuming in the afternoon once the tour ends. I would just explore the city afterwards.\n\n**Day 7** \\- ***Sapa***\n\n* Go solo to Fansipan mountain by cable car\n* Stay the night\n\n**Day 8/9/10** \\- ***Da Nang/Hoi An***\n\n* Undecided on what I want to do, I'm looking to just chill on a beach, potentially a day tour to Phong Nha?\n\n**Day 11** \\- Fly out to Manila from ***Hoi An*** airport\n\n  \nPlease let me know what you think you my itinerary.\n\n",

And the most important is the budget.\nMine will be small and I wanted an approximation of what would I need to live per month (not counting the flights from and back home then).\n\n- i plan on living in dormitories in hostels. This is no problem for me. I've done the Camino de Santiago in France and Spain and slept in shared dormitories for 65 days straight. If it's not too expensive and the hostels have available, I'll just book a private room every 10 days or so just to fully recharge.\nAs long as the hostel is near the center of cities its OK for me. I dont need the luxurious ones. I've seen some of them for 6\u20ac per night in Thailand I think.\n\n- I dont plan on visiting expensive countries. For some reason Japan or south Korean really dont appeal for me like they appeal to some people.\nI'd like to do Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam. Maybe Brunei if I have the occasion. Nepal would be my dream but is pretty far away so lets not count on it.\n\n- Im bad at cooking and I dont like that. So I guess id be eating out more often than not. Except when you do group meals in the hostel, that's so cool. I generally dont eat breakfast so its only two meals a day instead of 3.\nAlso a beer or two every each and while in a cool bar. I'm not fan of the expensive nightclubs ones.\n\n- transportation wise, is hitchhiking working well in SEA ? If yes, I'll do that and buses in countries and of course planes between them. Maybe you can just take boats sometimes ? Again, I got the time and not the money. I just took a 12H train instead of a 1h30 plane just to save 70\u20ac. I dont care about how long it takes. I can also walk long distances it's not a problem.\n\n- activities I'm more about visiting temples, doing hikes and things like that, compared to jetski or yacht tour, idk if I'm very clear or not ?\n\n- and life things : washer dryer sometimes, sending postcards, buying new shoes or everything that you usually dont take into account.\n\n- For the time it would be between 6 months to 1 year ? Maybe more ? I dont know. I'm young, healthy I just want to discover the world and meet people.\n\nWhat would you personally think a lifestyle like that would cost per month in SEA ? Of course I know some countries would be more or less expensive than others.\n\nSorry if this post is long and dumb but I'm a total noob. And articles I read online for budget are talking about people with real jobs and booking hotels and all. Not about how to do it young and dumb.\nThanks for reading.",

In my next trip I would be interested in activities that are a bit more active to help maintain my fitness and not on the usual \"top 10 things to see in Malaysia\" lists. \n\nI am fairly flexible on the location but prefer it to be on mainland Malaysia as I just came back from Borneo recently. Hiking and Jungle treks seem plentiful, although it gets a bit samey sometimes, especially as I just done a whole bunch of Borneo jungle treks recently.\n\nStuff I have already done:\n\n* Mt Kinabalu national park + Climbing Mt Kinabalu\n* Mulu national park, Adventure Caving + Pinnacles Climb (loved it here and will go back in a future trip but I was there just 2 months ago)\n* ATV Riding near KL\n* Batu Caves, Petronas, KLCC, Pavillion, Berjaya Time Square, Sunway Lagoon, Genting Highlands, Kek\n* I have been to Langkawi & Tioman multiple times and done snorkelling and diving there. Not keen to go again this trip.\n\nSome of the stuff I am considering:\n\n* Taman Negara excursion(s) - Although there is a solo surcharge for most activities it seems of +300MYR\n* Rock climbing session in KL\n* Waterfall abseiling, KL outskirts\n* Penang National Park\n* White water rafting at Gopeng, Perak\n* Any recs for somewhere nice to go Kayaking?\n* Cameron Highlands - Tea tours and hiking\n* Cycling Day trip, outskirts of KL",

But if I fly to another airport, I\u2019d kind of have to drive back? Would it be easier to **start with a Greek island**, fly there first, and then pick up a car for the road trip? Any better options?\n\n\ud83d\ude99 **Car Rental Logistics in Turkey**  \nI\u2019m struggling to figure out the best place to **pick up and drop off the car** to avoid unnecessary long drives or backtracking.

Open to better ideas!\n\n\ud83c\udfdd **Best Turkish or Greek islands for beaches & natural beauty?**  \nI am considering **Symi** but trying to figure out the best way to get there **without too many flights**. Any other islands worth adding?\n\n\u26f4 **Best way to connect Greece & Turkey?**  \nLooking for the smoothest way to move between islands and back to Turkey. I thought about doing a **5-day Gulet cruise**,  but not sure if it would be too expensive. Any alternative ways to explore multiple islands easily?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Any red flags or better ways to structure this?**  \nI\u2019m happy to **do the Greek Islands first** if that makes logistics easier, especially since I need to fly back to Istanbul at the end.",

        "selftext": "Hello, I hope everyone is well! I am (hopefully) looking toward a trip to Kyrgyzstan later this year, and wanted to ask a few logistical questions to those in-the-know. (Cross-posting from r/Kyrgyzstan, since my post hasn't gotten mod-cleared yet.)\n\nThis trip is projected to begin and end in Osh. Direct flights from where I live seem virtually nonexistent, but finding flights to Bishkek is no problem. It seems the most popular/most widely recommended option from Bishkek to Osh is to grab a shared taxi - with that in mind:\n\n1) How are the taxis comfort-wise? I'm a tall lad (6'2ish) so at ~13hrs travel time, my legs are already cringing. Should I just to try and get first dibs on the front seat? Are there stop-offs for food, or best to bring snacks? Bathroom breaks, etc.? Any other insight or advice would be appreciated.\n\n2) How close does the taxi route get to the Tajik border? Please don't get me wrong, I'm truly not worried/paranoid/etc. and I imagine it's plenty safe, I just caught the State Dept. caution to \"reconsider travel\" within 30km of the border, and I have a few people in my life who are prone to worry about me (which I appreciate). So if I can tell those folks, \"Look, it's not within 30km,\" I'm sure it would assuage their concerns.\n\n3) Am I right to forego a direct flight between Bishkek and Osh? I'd opted out because of safety concerns, but now I read about some airlines maybe getting taken off the EU's safety blacklist?\n\nHonest to goodness I'm relaxed about visiting lol, just the logistics are a little more particular than I'm used to, so trying to weigh my transport options. Maybe I just book a separate flight to Istanbul/Dubai and fly direct to Osh from there, but also I'm curious to see Bishkek, sooo...decisions, hah. I'm dying to visit, so any wisdom folks can share would be most helpful and most appreciated! Thanks much in advance.",

They then continued \"You have a condition! It's a bad condition we noticed.\"\n\nImmediately I knew this was some street scam, but was completely uncertain what. I had never heard this one before, so I played along as ignorant. They then continued to explain it's an issue with my liver or kidney and that they know of an ointment nearby that will cure it. THERE IT IS lol. I tried not to crack up so I played more ignorant and they started doubling down on side effects and telling me they can get me a deal if I follow them. \n\nThey then began to get more serious and said something like \"Yeah your gut too! It will begin to grow to the point it's huge and needs major surgery.\" At this point I was bored of it and said \"ah I can just take a shit for that.\"\n\nThey didn't like that, told me to fuck off and left me alone.

        "selftext": "Hello!\nIt's been a long time since I travelled solo and I'm really worried, but decided to jump the gun and fulfill a lifelong dream this year. So, I am going to Kathmandu for the first time in October for 4 full days (+0.5 if you consider the last day, where I flying out around 9pm).\n\nI want to do the following in order of priority but in what order should I do it? Where should I stay and for how long? It's a little hard to know how long it takes to travel between areas so I hope to get some information on travelling in/around the area, and a suggested itinerary that's focused on culture/history/temples.\n\nI don't hike much, but could maybe do an hour or two if you think the view is absolutely worth it. But I'm 99.999% sure I'm skipping Pokhara/chitwan because it seems just a bit too far/touristy.\n\nWhat I want to do:\n\n- Everest sightseeing flight (airplane, not helicopter)\n- Bhaktapur dubar square\n- boudhanath\n- Kathmandu durbar square\n- pashupatinath\n- lalitpur(patan?) durbar square\n- other world heritage sites or temples that you can recommend\n\nOther questions:\n\n1. I fly in Kathmandu around 10pm in the evening. What is the best mode of transportation from the airport to the hotel?\n\n2. Any recommended hotels in each area?\n\n3. Any recommended Everest flight airlines/providers/other legit tour companies for our other places of interest?\n\n4. Is nagarkot or dhulikhel worth it? If so, how to go and long should I spend there?\n\n5. I have a sensitive stomach so I'm a bit worried about food. I heard that we shouldn't drink the tap water or buy anything from the market vendor that we didn't see them cook...are there enough western restaurants or supermarkets from which to buy food? Any advice regarding food is also welcome.\n\nThank you so much in advance for helping this newbie!",

Im a bit hesitant to take mongolian bus ride because - to state the obvious - im not Feeling quite safe and comfortable to sit in a mongolian bus for 9 Hours, on the ether Hand im sure this will be a once in a Lifetime experience. Would you say its worth it, has anybody ever done something like that here?\n\nDoes anybody know if this is a scenic road from Zamyn-\u00dc\u00fcd to beijing (havent seen anything on google) because its not About the money for me. Its about experience but also making the most of my time there.\n\nAlso is it worth to stay for 3 days in bejing? (approx. 1st of nevember until the 3rd) whats a cool district te stay in - i have seen sanlitun this seems like a fun place? \nto Keep in mind im 23m - (24m when im there) and love photogcaphy, great Food and \"Young\" Areas - so this should fit the criteria right?\n\nafter the time in Peking i either want to take the Train to Shanghai or Hongkong - out of experience what did you like more? im hoping to make the most of the time and i think if i take so many trains ill miss out on about half a\nday (Peking - Shanghai 4 Hours dicect Train and te Hongkong about 8) or is this irrational?\n\nis there a place i am missing, something more worth it, something i have to see that i havent thought About??\n\nAfter that ill fly back home to Vienna",

        "selftext": "Even typing that sentence sends a shiver down my spine and I can feel my stomach tightening. Background, I'm a 33 year old European male with 10+ years experience in the live music and entertainment industry. I'm not sure if I'm having a crisis or not but next month I leave for India with absolutely no plan. \n\nI'm incredibly lucky to be in the position I am. I've built a career in music and live events from literally nothing to working for the biggest concert promoter in the world. Over the last few years I've started to feel incredibly unfulfilled by it all, my desire for material goods fell away naturally and I found myself only wanting money to fund things like yoga teacher trainings, surf trips or wellness retreats. My sense of self started to come into question more and more, the career and life path I thought I was on started to look more and more like a prison sentence. I stopped partying, my relationship to alcohol changed and I found my circle growing much smaller. It can be incredibly lonely at times but my appreciation and gratitude towards the everyday things like a morning coffee, a sunset, surfing and time with family have grown abundantly. \n\nA while ago the idea of travelling extensively came into my mind and became some sort of a loose plan to work towards financially. I've always been relatively smart with my money and now thankfully I'm at over \u20ac100,000 in savings. \n\nI've travelled extensively before, sometimes solo trips sometimes with friends or partners but never mindfully. I've always travelled with a sense of attachment or clinging, either to an outcome, how I wanted to feel or what I thought an experience should be. I'm so afraid of making the same mistakes again, I'm so afraid that I'm throwing away my future, that i'm just lost, that it will be too late to build another career, meet someone and start a conventional life. I'm so afraid that I'm just being selfish and hedonistic.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for in this post or by embarking on this trip for that matter, I guess I'm hoping you might read this and have something to share. Advice, a similar story or situation, thoughts or criticism, I welcome it all. Thanks for reading x\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "**Hey!**\n\nAt the end of May, I'm going on a month-long trip to Japan and Korea. I'm currently looking for the right shoes. After researching, I'm torn between the New Balance 530 and Nike Vomero 5.\n\nI went to a Nike store to try some on, and the sales assistant told me that no shoes are as good as running shoes. She recommended a few for me to try, and the moment I put on the new Nike Vomero 18s, I instantly felt a difference\u2014like walking on a cloud. I'm willing to pay more if it means minimizing foot pain after walking 20k steps every day.\n\nWhen I tried on the Vomero 5 and NB 530, I didn\u2019t feel the same level of comfort as with the Vomero 18. Now, I\u2019m unsure which ones to choose. Some people say that running shoes aren't suitable for long-distance walking in the long run, while others argue that running shoes are actually much better than \"comfortable lifestyle\" shoes like the Vomero 5 or New Balance 530.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion? This is the first time I genuinely want to buy the most comfortable shoes possible.\n\nFor context: in 2024, I went on two week-long trips where I wore my Nike Dunk Lows and walked around 25k steps per day. By the end of those trips, I was limping, and I don\u2019t want to experience that again\u2014especially since this trip will last a whole month.",

        "selftext": "Before you start typing about how I'm wrong and have no clue what I'm talking about, please read the entire post.\n\nI travel a lot for work and a lot for vacation compared to the average person. I have status on airlines, hotel chains, and car rental companies. \n\nFirst things first, UNLESS YOU'RE EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT AVIATION CONSUMER PROTECTIONS, ALWAYS BOOK FLIGHTS DIRECTLY WITH THE AIRLINE. NEVER USE THIRD PARTY SITES FOR FLIGHTS. The FAA has protections that are voided if booked through a third party.\n\nI see a lot of posts on reddit about how booking directly with the hotel is always the cheapest. This is wrong and the opposite from my actual experience both within the US and internationally. I book directly with hotels for work and almost exclusively use third party websites for personal travel.\n\nI've used many different sites to book hotels. Super.com, Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia, and more are common for me. \n\nWill hotels match those sites' prices? From my experience, rarely. Well what about price match guarantee? The price match that hotels use is a marketing tactic. If you read the terms and conditions for the guarantee, they make it virtually impossible for a price you find to qualify due to irrelevant reasons.\n\nThe single most important thing to look at when using third party sites is the final price. There are sometimes fees added on which can make it more expensive than originally thought. That doesn't mean it's not still cheaper than booking directly. Also make sure to look at cancellation terms and what room type you're getting. This is where most people don't pay attention and have regrets.\n\nI will admit they do try to scam you sometimes but you need to be smart. \n\nHere is one great example from a recent trip.\n\n3 nights, King Bed, near Seattle\nHampton Inn (Everett)\nBooking directly: $326 total\nBooking with Super.com: $241 total\n\nThe room was great and had a view of the water. No hassle at all.\n\nFor this booking, Super.com tried to sell me breakfast for $27 a night which is free at Hampton Inn. This is how they keep prices low. They sell you something you would get anyways. This doesn't always happen but is something to watch out for.\n\nI have diamond status at Hampton Inn but it still made more sense to book using a third party than direct. That doesn't mean there aren't benefits by booming directly. With many hotels, you can pick your room during mobile check in if you book directly. Since I'm usually looking for the best deal and a clean place to sleep, I don't worry about picking a room.\n\nI have taken trips across the United States, Europe, Iceland, and next week I'll be going to Japan for 2 weeks. Nearly every single time I book hotels, I use third party sites. Every single hotel in Japan in through Agoda except for one through Rakuten. They we're all substantially cheaper than booking directly. \n\nWith over 40 hotels, I've never had any issues with using third party sites either. I've read so many horror stories on Reddit about how the websites lie to you about which hotel you're actually getting or how they got the boiler room of the hotel because they didn't book directly. \n\nI just wanted to put my experiences out there since they've been different from what I've been reading.\n\nTLDR; Third Party Sites are almost always cheaper for travel if you pay attention to what you're getting and hotels don't actually care you didn't book directly.",

In 2018, those would have costed 25 lira each, or about 5 euros or even less, depending on what month you visited.\n\nFirst off, I have visited the Galata Tower in Beyoglu. I climbed the Kamondo stairs in order to get to the Galata Tower. Even though it was first built in 528 during Justinian's rule, the Crusaders destroyed the Galata Tower and rebuilt it in its current form in 1349 in the Romanesque style. Uponing entering, I entered the lift, which would take me to the 6th floor, and then I made the ascent to the 7th floor. In the 7th floor, you are greeted with a model of Istanbul and in the 8th floor, you are greeted with the observation deck.\n\nOnce you descend into the 5th floor, you are greeted to some artefacts from the Neolithic, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and early Ottoman eras, and in the 4th floor, you are treated with more artefacts. In the 3rd floor, it depicts some 16th century astronomers, and the 2nd floor is where the Galata tower gallery is. The 1st floor is where the gift shop is. Overall, there is quite little content for 30 euros.\n\nOn the next day, I visited the Maiden's Tower on the Bosphorous. I took a metro all the way to the Karakoy Pier, and there, I started taking a ferry to the Maiden's Tower (which is a nice quirk), and the Maiden's Tower is extremely spartan. There are only three museum wall texts, depicting the history of the Maiden Tower, legend, and renovations/repairs, in both Turkish and Englishh. You do find three Cannon mortars and an observation deck where you could see the European and Asian side of Istanbul, but apart from the boat ride, the museum is very spartan. After 30 minutes, I headed to Uskudar and enjoyed the Asian side of Istanbul.\n\nEven though some tourist attractions in Istanbul are extremely expensive, every single religious site (except the Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, and Kariye Mosque) are free. Both the Egyptian bazaar and Grand bazaar are free to enter as well. Even though some restaurants charge upwards of 600 TL, I could find full meals like the Adana kebab and chicken and rice for as low as 200-250 TL (5-6.50 EUR). A 500 mL bottle of water costs 10 TL on average (about 0.25 EUR) and I found water that costs as less as 4 TL. Hotels are quite affordable as well. I booked a 5-star Holiday Inn Hotel in Fatih last minute for 55 USD a night and I found Hotel Orkide, which is a Russian owned hotel with a single bed, private restroom, AC, and Wi-Fi for 20 USD a night.\n\nThe reasons why I believe the Galata/Maiden's Tower are overpriced for foreigners is because:\n\nDuring the low season, the entire Palais de Versailles + the gardens only cost 21 EUR\n\nThe Eiffel Tower costs 14.50 EUR for adults for the least expensive fare (2nd floor via stairs) and 23.10 EUR for adults for the 2nd floor via lift. The most expensive ticket is 36.10 EUR for the top. Even though I graduated from uni with a CS degree in 2022, I will turn 24 in September 2025, rendering me as \"qualifying\" for the student ticket, which could slash the prices by half.\n\nThe Louvre costs 22 EUR\n\nThe Colloseum costs 18 EUR\n\nThe Acropolis complex in Athens costs 20 EUR\n\nThe Topology of Terror in Berlin is free\n\nThe British Museum is free\n\nThe Smithsonian Museums are free\n\nThe Statue of Liberty costs 33 USD (about 30 EUR)\n\nThe Thang Long Citadel in Hanoi only costs 100k VND (about 3.60 EUR)\n\nThe Imperial City of Hue costs 200k VND (about 7.20 EUR)\n\nThe Independence Palace + Norodom Palace exhibition in HCMC costs 65000 VND (about 2.30 EUR)\n\nVietnam is ultra affordable.",

I booked a 5-star Holiday Inn Hotel in Fatih last minute for 55 USD a night and I found Hotel Orkide, which is a Russian owned hotel with a single bed, private restroom, AC, and Wi-Fi for 20 USD a night.\n\nThe reasons why I believe the Galata/Maiden's Tower are overpriced for foreigners is because:\n\nDuring the low season, the entire Palais de Versailles + the gardens only cost 21 EUR\n\nThe Eiffel Tower costs 14.50 EUR for adults for the least expensive fare (2nd floor via stairs) and 23.10 EUR for adults for the 2nd floor via lift. The most expensive ticket is 36.10 EUR for the top. Even though I graduated from uni with a CS degree in 2022, I will turn 24 in September 2025, rendering me as \"qualifying\" for the student ticket, which could slash the prices by half.\n\nThe Louvre costs 22 EUR\n\nThe Colloseum costs 18 EUR\n\nThe Acropolis complex in Athens costs 20 EUR\n\nThe Topology of Terror in Berlin is free\n\nThe British Museum is free\n\nThe Smithsonian Museums are free\n\nThe Statue of Liberty costs 33 USD (about 30 EUR)\n\nThe Thang Long Citadel in Hanoi only costs 100k VND (about 3.60 EUR)\n\nThe Imperial City of Hue costs 200k VND (about 7.20 EUR)\n\nThe Independence Palace + Norodom Palace exhibition in HCMC costs 65000 VND (about 2.30 EUR)\n\nVietnam is ultra affordable.",

I am wondering if you would have any suggestions or advice. Perhaps there are other destinations I haven't considered that would be really interesting to see on a trip like this? I am trying to do this whilst I am still young and don't have a family, so I am keen for a very adventurous holiday - so if you have any crazy ideas, let me know, and I will definitely look into them (I did consider an Iron Ore Train in Mauretania..!) I've also been trying to mainly include countries that require a bit more effort to get to, trying to leave to more accessible (e.g. North America) as places where you can \"easily\" go when having a family (although I know that you can do that to all of these but some require more logistics than others) :) \n\nAs mentioned earlier, any advice is welcomed!\n\nWould there be any other places in Africa and Asia you'd suggest?",

My friend and I packed light, had no fixed itinerary, and just followed our curiosity each day\u2014stopping wherever looked interesting, asking locals for tips, and soaking in the freedom of the ride.\n\nWe started in Sanur, then hit Keramas, Sidemen, Kintamani, Tejakula, Amed, Padang Bai, and finished the trip on Gili T. The mix of mountains, quiet villages, coastal roads, and diving spots gave us a solid blend of nature, culture, and chill time without the crowds.\n\nWe kept things budget-friendly, stayed in homestays, and mostly ate local warung meals. It\u2019s a great route if you\u2019re into motorbiking, spontaneous exploration, and want a different side of Bali than the usual party/tourist circuit.\n\nI filmed the whole thing and cut it into a short travel video\u2014happy to share it if anyone\u2019s planning something similar or just wants a dose of tropical inspiration.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently refining my active hiking clothing setup \u2013 just the stuff I wear on my body. No backpack, no sleep system, no extras. My main hiking destinations are Patagonia (summer), Japan (humid and warm), and the Alps (summer).\n\nI\u2019m not chasing the lowest possible weight. What matters most to me is comfort, breathability, sweat management, and high-quality materials. I\u2019m fine spending serious money if the performance is worth it. I prefer to buy from the EU to avoid customs, taxes, and return problems \u2013 but if something from North America is really worth it, I\u2019m open.\n\nRecently, I ordered several pieces from Wowool using Polartec Alpha Direct. Here\u2019s my honest feedback:\n\nThe Alpha Direct 90 hoodie (Taray Duck) is a big disappointment. The cut is terrible for me \u2013 it\u2019s too short at the waist, and when I pull the hood up, the whole garment rides up. The hood itself ends above my forehead, and if I pull it into place, the entire hoodie becomes basically a crop top.\n\nThe fabric itself (Alpha 90) is okay for camp use only, like hanging around after hiking, but definitely not for hiking.\n\nThe Alpha Direct 60 camp pants (Salute Blue) are comfortable, but again, only for resting \u2013 not movement.\n\nI also have the Alpha 90 socks, Alpha 90 neck warmer, and a merino headband \u2013 those are fine for camp use, not active wear.\n\n\nI will keep all these items for camp and downtime, but none of them (except maybe the neck warmer) will be part of my future layering system for hiking.\n\nFor base layers:\n\nI use the ECWCS Gen III Level 1 pants, original US military issue, made from Polartec Power Dry. They are excellent \u2013 breathable, dry fast, and feel great.\n\nI also have a Power Dry sun hoodie and matching buff, both from Immersion Research. They\u2019re decent, but I still get a wet, cold back when sweating a lot \u2013 and that\u2019s something I really hate. So I\u2019m looking for a better solution for my upper body.\n\n\nAs a shell:\n\nI use the Mammut Nordwand Pro HS (Gore-Tex Pro). It normally retails for around \u20ac850, but I got it brand new for \u20ac350 at an outlet.\n\nYes, it\u2019s heavy and not very packable, but it\u2019s super comfortable, and I love how it wears. I\u2019d prefer to keep using it, unless there\u2019s a very good reason to replace it. I\u2019d love your opinion on this shell.\n\n\nUnderwear:\n\nI use Saxx Quest 2.0 Boxer Briefs (with fly) \u2013 super comfortable, quick-drying\n\n\nShoes:\n\nLowa Zephyr GTX MID MK2 (waterproof, stable, solid grip)\n\nAltra Olympus 6 Hike MID (zero drop, max cushion, Vibram outsole)\n\n\nSocks:\n\nDarn Tough Light Hiker Quarter Lightweight (Space Gray)\n\nDarn Tough Coolmax Hiker Micro Crew Midweight (Gray/Black)\n\nWowool Merino + X-STATIC silver crew socks (gray) \u2013 great odor control\n\nWowool Merino low-cut socks (lake blue) \u2013 thinner option for hot days\n\nWowool Alpha Direct 90 socks \u2013 mostly for camp\n\nWowool Merino headband \u2013 for cold mornings/evenings\n\nProlla ultralight trekking umbrella (82\u202fg) \u2013 great for sun and light rain\n\n\nAgain: I'm not looking to win any baseweight competition. I want a system that works, keeps me dry and comfortable, and that I actually enjoy wearing.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for now:\n\nSomething better than Alpha Direct \u2013 possibly Primaloft AirPerm, or something else?\n\nA base layer top that won\u2019t get sticky or cold on my back when sweating\n\nA midlayer that\u2019s breathable, flexible, doesn\u2019t cling, and has a better cut\n\nSuggestions for long-lasting, EU-available performance pieces that are worth the money\n\nYour thoughts on my current Mammut shell \u2013 should I keep it?\n\n\nWhat would you change or upgrade in my system?\nAny materials, brands, or tricks I should look into?\nThanks so much \u2013 really appreciate your help and experience!\n\nGreetings from Germany ",

I have travelled with friends/partners and once done a vague backpack trip domestically, but this is the first time I'm considering an international trip in Europe and that too by myself.\n\nSince I'm doing it the first time, I'm considering these touring groups that offer to take groups of people on these backpacking tours - the backpacking with young people, make new friends kinda schtick. They come with an itinerary, cost roughly around 100k+ INR (not including visa fees, flights, local travel etc.) for a \\~12 day trip across 3-4 countries.\n\nMy question is, are they generally a good option? Has anyone **(especially from India)** gone through these groups before? Are they worth it? Their website and itinerary seem really appealing - anyone who has gone through them - does it live up to the hype?",

        "selftext": "Firstly I have to say I am extremely nervous, both for this trip and to hear what people have to say. I know so many people who have travelled to India and love it, and so many who have done the same and hated it.\n\nI am needing to travel to India to do some fieldwork for my dissertation, thankfully, for the fieldwork I will have the assistance of local hosts to help me out. However, the fieldwork is only for a period of two weeks, and in order to get my trip funded by my faculty, it needs to be 4, hence, solo travelling in India. \n\nMy fieldwork will be based in an area around the North of New Delhi, so whilst I'm willing to get trains for the last two weeks of my trip, that's where I'm based.\n\nPlease help me with all the tips and tricks you could possibly give me, either for 2 weeks in Delhi, or for where I should head instead for that period. The only remotely relatable experience I have in terms of travelling and in places where the culture is somewhat overwhelming or very different to my own - especially in terms of the appropriate actions/attitudes of men towards women is rural South Africa, and that was a university trip with local guides and staff members who had been multiple times previous.\n\n(F22, 9 countries visited)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m graduating from college this year and have been thinking a lot about taking some time to travel. I\u2019ve worked in IT for the past three years, but I have no mortgage, no kids, no major responsibilities tying me down\u2014so I figure now\u2019s the best time to go.\n\nRather than jumping straight into another job or locking myself into an apartment I can barely afford, I want to take a one-way trip to **Ireland and make my way east across Europe, ending in Istanbul.** I\u2019d give myself around a year, maybe a year and a half, depending on how things go. I\u2019m planning to save **$4K\u2013$6K** before I leave, but I know I\u2019ll need to find ways to make money along the way.\n\n# My Question:\n\nFor those of you who have backpacked long-term, how did you fund your travels? I\u2019d love to hear real experiences.\n\n# Work Options I\u2019m Considering:\n\n* Bartending, barback, or serving (but not sure how easy it is to find under-the-table gigs) \n* Bike courier/delivery work (but I\u2019ve heard you need a local bank account\u2014anyone done this?) \n* Hostel or hospitality work \n* Any other odd jobs travelers tend to find\n\nIf you\u2019ve worked while traveling, how did you do it? Are there certain countries where it\u2019s easier to find short-term gigs? Any good Facebook groups or websites for finding work?\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice, stories, or tips you\u2019ve got! Thanks in advance.\n\np.s. For those of you wondering, yes, this post was written by chatGPT, I suck at writing lol. ",

I love travelling alone and definitely have the charisma to survive alone, you get the point.\n\nAnyway, because of this waitlist, I honestly feel so fucking lost, I yearn for a real struggle and some wacky adventure I'd die for I feel like it would be peaceful in some way.\n\n# The plan\n\nAnyway my plan is to get the ferry over to Normandy and trek to Istanbul with a budget of 100 quid. Yes you read that correctly. I'm not going to list the finer details of what I'm bringing but essentially the essentials of being able to survive. (and obviously emergency money)\n\nThis would be in the deep end of backpacking/treking.\n\nHow impossible is this.\n\nEdit: it'll take atleast 44 days of just walking I know some countries it's illegal to go wild camping but that shouldn't be an issue. also not a fan of the idea of walking in the south of europe during the summer.

I was hoping I could get some advice from more experienced backpackers since this is going to be my first backpacking trip and I'm going on my own. \n\nI'm planning on doing at least two months in Asia but aiming for three. I can't do much planning because I'm currently applying for jobs in my field and hoping I can get a visa-sponsorship in Australia, but it is looking very unlikely.

In July my boyfriend joins me in Vietnam which we will travel for 5 weeks, before travelling to Sri Lanka for a few weeks to meet some family in mid August. \n\nAfter August, me and my boyfriend want to plan to travel for another few months until late November. Our initial idea was to complete SE Asia by doing 1 month in each of Malaysia, Indonesia & the Philippines. However I\u2019m now thinking against this idea as: \n\nA) they are culturally and geographically similar to the other countries that I would have at this point spent 6 months travelling through, and am predicting at this point a change of scenery might be needed. \nB) As me and my boyfriend are both gay, we also have reservations about Indonesia & Malaysia, which are both quite homophobic. We understand as tourists we wouldn\u2019t be in much danger, but it still would be 2 months of us not being able to act like a couple in public. \n\nI would 100% come back to this region another time in my life and when I do I can visit Indonesia and Malaysia on that trip. \n\nSo we are now thinking to visit Japan, and some other countries in September & October before going to the Philippines in November. \n\nWe are considering Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and maybe Hong Kong or even China? Which countires should we go to and in which order? How would you suggest splitting this time up with about 8-9 weeks of travel time from early September - early November? \nOr are there any other countries we should consider? \n\nThank you all in advance for any advice!

We understand as tourists we wouldn\u2019t be in much danger, but it still would be 2 months of us not being able to act like a couple in public. \n\nI would 100% come back to this region another time in my life and when I do I can visit Indonesia and Malaysia on that trip. \n\nSo we are now thinking to visit Japan, and some other countries in September & October before going to the Philippines in November. \n\nWe are considering Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and maybe Hong Kong or even China? Which countires should we go to and in which order? How would you suggest splitting this time up with about 8-9 weeks of travel time from early September - early November? \nOr are there any other countries we should consider? \n\nThank you all in advance for any advice!

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm a 30 yo guy from Germany and about to go onto my first solo adventure backpacking in Thailand. I've been researching for a while, however I still wanna get some more opinions of seasoned experienced veterans, so this sub was an obvious destination. I'm hoping to profit from your guys' shared wisdom! I wanna focus mostly on experiencing the street food and food over all, nature and culture. Not really looking for heavy partying tho I might give one of those fool moon parties a try. \n\nI know it's gonna be pretty hot but due to my personal situation this is the perfect time for me to travel. I wanna focus mostly on April but depending on the regional weather maybe go a bit deeper into May? Which regions should I mostly try to avoid due to the heat season and where is it tolerable at this time of year? Or is it generally too late for that? \n\nAlso one question I have is about the flight back. Since this is gonna be my first tour I'm thinking about not already booking a flight back to be more flexible (if I wanna stay longer or shorter depending on how it goes). However, I've read that you have to show some indication of when you're gonna leave the country again so is this idea even an option?\n\nI also read about the fact that hostels aren't the only cheap affordable housing options so I'm curious about what else is out there. Not really looking to meet a bunch of 18-20 yo party beasts haha.\n\nAt last I'd be happy to just know about some known helpful apps and must haves for my backpack and ofc any other helpful advice you can give me!\n\nI greatly appreciate anyones help and opinion! Thanks so much in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI hope this is the right sub for this. If not, I\u2019ll be happy to remove my post, but please don\u2019t be hard on me if my question is kinda stupid :)\n\nIn September, for the first time I\u2019m going to be backpacking in the sense that I\u2019ll be going to Vietnam for 3 weeks and since we\u2019re going to be moving around a lot during these three weeks, I want to take a backpack instead of a suitcase or something.\n\nWe will be flying in to Hanoi, where we will be staying for a week (with 2-3 days in Sapa planned), then we will fly to Da Nang or Hue, a week later from there to Ho Chi Minh City and after almost 3 weeks back home from there. Lots of travelling via bus and trains planned as well.\n\nThe problem is, I have no idea how that works, no experience.\n\nIdeally, I would like to use some sort of backpack (which i still need to buy, too) that I can bring as a carry-on onto the plane because a) its cheaper, b) if my luggage got lost, I\u2019d have nothing, and c) it\u2019s not hard shell like a suitcase and I\u2019d be scared some of my stuff would break.\n\nHowever, I can\u2019t imagine being able to pack clothes for even close to 2-3 weeks into a backpack that is small enough to bring on to the plane with you. \n\nI realise that most likely, I\u2019ll have to try and wash clothes when I\u2019m there since you can\u2019t really pack 3 weeks worth of clothes into a backpack no matter how big haha.\n\nBut how do people usually tackle this problem? Is it not actually a problem and I\u2019m just overthinking it? How big of a backpack is the sweet spot? Any recommendations for backpacks for this kind of travel?\n\nSince I am a complete newbie to this, I\u2019d honestly be happy for any and every piece of advice you guys have got for me :) ",

        "selftext": "Hello \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd My boyfriend and I will be visiting Vietnam for 20 days this upcoming July and August. I have tried to put together an itinerary for our trip, but I just can\u2019t seem to figure out how bad the weather actually is during that time. Please don\u2019t tell me to use Google, because I have been googling for months, but I keep finding conflicting information\u2014one page says it\u2019s the rainy season in the area I\u2019m searching, while the next one says it\u2019s the dry season. I know central Vietnam will likely have the best weather, but I\u2019m afraid of missing out if I stick to only that. So my question is: how bad is it to travel around the rest of Vietnam during these months? Am I unnecessarily missing out on amazing scenery by staying mostly near the beaches? Thanks in advance",

        "selftext": "Hello! My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) are currently traveling in India and we're quite frankly hating it. To be fair, we initially visited Ladakh, which was amazing, however now we're in Rajastan, and it's been hellish. We've traveled to a good amount of countries and we agree that it's the one we like the least. \n\nTo be specific, we can't stand constantly being hassled by touts and tuktuks, the fact that 90% of all the people on the street and in businesses are men, especially since the way some men stare at me makes me want to vomit. It just means that we don't enjoy visiting attractions, walking down the street or even experiencing the culture. \n\nWe wanted to visit Sri Lanka after, but we're worried that, the culture being similar, we won't enjoy it. Can anyone who has visited the two countries let us know if we'll have the same experience?\n\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your comments. Lots of people have said to head to the south. We were thinking of heading to Sri Lanka rather than to the south of India as there is lots of wildlife and many national parks, beaches that we are excited to visit. Before anyone says we'll find that in south India as well, which we're aware of, can we ask what the level of hassle, stares, and attention towards me as a white woman, would we find in south India as compared to Sri Lanka. Also, what is the male / female ratio on the streets and in businesses. So I'm asking for a South India vs Sri Lanka comparison at this point. Thanks everyone ",

I\u2019m happy to stay in hostels although would be nice to stay in the odd cheap low cost hotel even if it isn\u2019t the nicest. \n\nI don\u2019t want to come away and end up blowing it quickly meaning I have to come home early or cancel the Australia part but at the same time I\u2019m eager to go as soon as I can so want to try be out by next winter at most meaning I maybe can\u2019t be as comfortable and as safe as some may recommend. \n\nMy auntie lives in Australia so I would be able to stay at hers the first few weeks which might help out while I desperately look for work even though I know it\u2019s likely to take longer than this but I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll find something however I have heard some stories about how in demand it is currently!",

By that, I mean a place to stay, food, water, stable internet, phone costs, and everything I need to live comfortably. The goal is to eat, sleep, and live on this budget without worrying about work, jobs, or additional income, except for some unexpected and optional costs, which I\u2019ll keep to a max of $100-150 extra.\n\nTop priorities for me are affordability, security, stable internet, reliable phone service (calls and SMS), clean water, food that\u2019s safe to eat, and a comfortable place to stay. I don\u2019t need luxury or anything extra \u2013 just the basics to live a peaceful, low-cost lifestyle.\n\nI\u2019ve got my sights set on Indonesia as my top priority, followed by Vietnam, and I\u2019m also considering the Philippines and other similarly affordable countries.

I am planning an extensive around the world trip. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be going this autumn/winter or next year - it all depends on how much I\u2019ll save up this year. \n\nI seek advice and help for the trip overall but also for individual destinations and to know how long I should stay to get the experience I\u2019m hoping for. Would love to know what your itineraries was for the trip or if you can recommend excursions or landmarks to see/not see? And also how long you recommend me staying in each country? I don\u2019t want to plan too much and too tight as my plan is to stay an extra day(s) if I like the place or move on if the opposite.\n\nI\u2019ll start in\nMadagascar(for experiencing the unique nature and wildlife)->\n\nTanzania(going on a safari and also to visit Zanzibar and learn how to surf)->\n\nSeychelles(I imagine the islands to have nice bounty beaches but not much else to do so I\u2019ll probably only spend a few days here?)->\n\nSri Lanka(to just chill out and surf and learn to skateboard as well - in need of personal recommendations)->\n\nNepal(would love to see a witch doctor and channel some spirituality and go hiking)->\n\n\u2018Banana pancake trail\u2019/Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, maybe also Malaysia?, Singapore(only for a few days as I\u2019ve already been), Indonesia & Philippines(this is for the culture and see temples but also spend time on the beach and experience the proper rookie backpacker experience)->\n\nSouth Korea(experience culture and the whole futuristic society vibe)->\n\nJapan(same as above but would also love to see the countryside and experience the serenity that the big screen always sell us)->\n\nSailing as a \u2018guest\u2019 on a boat in the pacific(I don\u2019t know the specific term for it but where I\u2019m from it\u2019s a thing to pay for being a guest on a smaller boat and then you do work on the boat together with others.

Would like to seek out a community to experience bbq on the beach and surfing and skateboarding etc. have been thinking about farm work and ranching really interest me although I have 0 experience.

I have been working abroad in different destinations for a few years so although I haven\u2019t backpacked I know the vibe and what to be aware of.\n\nMy overall plan is to seek people out in airports, hostels, on excursions, at a job I might pick up etc in order to be social and feel like I am travelling with somebody. Just for me to feel safe but also because I am a very extroverted person. My biggest wish for this trip is to get loads of experiences and see wonderful things but an even bigger wish is to have people to share it with(and I don\u2019t mean people at home ofc). Overall outcome is I\u2019m hoping to have people along the way who will surf and skate and have fun with me.\n\nI would like to maybe once a month or as needed check in to maybe a nicer hotel than the hostels in order to get a day or two to myself.

        "selftext": "Budget: 30-35.000 USD(what I\u2019m describing in this post is only half of the trip)\nDuration: 1-2 years (? am open to changes)\n\nHello, I (27f) want to quit my job and go backpacking for the first time. I am planning an extensive around the world trip. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be going this autumn/winter or next year - it all depends on how much I\u2019ll save up this year. \n\nI seek advice and help for the trip overall but also for individual destinations and to know how long I should stay to get the experience I\u2019m hoping for. Would love to know what your itineraries was for the trip or if you can recommend excursions or landmarks to see/not see? And also how long you recommend me staying in each country? I don\u2019t want to plan too much and too tight as my plan is to stay an extra day(s) if I like the place or move on if the opposite.\n\nI\u2019ll start in\nMadagascar(for experiencing the unique nature and wildlife)->\n\nTanzania(going on a safari and also to visit Zanzibar and learn how to surf)->\n\nSeychelles(I imagine the islands to have nice bounty beaches but not much else to do so I\u2019ll probably only spend a few days here?)->\n\nSri Lanka(to just chill out and surf and learn to skateboard as well - in need of personal recommendations)->\n\nNepal(would love to see a witch doctor and channel some spirituality and go hiking)->\n\n\u2018Banana pancake trail\u2019/Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, maybe also Malaysia?, Singapore(only for a few days as I\u2019ve already been), Indonesia & Philippines(this is for the culture and see temples but also spend time on the beach and experience the proper rookie backpacker experience)->\n\nSouth Korea(experience culture and the whole futuristic society vibe)->\n\nJapan(same as above but would also love to see the countryside and experience the serenity that the big screen always sell us)->\n\nSailing as a \u2018guest\u2019 on a boat in the pacific(I don\u2019t know the specific term for it but where I\u2019m from it\u2019s a thing to pay for being a guest on a smaller boat and then you do work on the boat together with others. It\u2019s very popular to do in the pacific to see the countries and islands from the water and \u2018easily\u2019 going from one to the other)->\n\nAustralia(planning to stay here for a while. Would like to seek out a community to experience bbq on the beach and surfing and skateboarding etc. have been thinking about farm work and ranching really interest me although I have 0 experience. Would love to learn how to ride a horse and be a ranch hand but I think it\u2019s difficult to get that offered with no experience.. besides that I would love to road trip(I know conditions and distance is crazy) and also see the west side)->\n\nNew Zealand(same as above. Would love a road trip and seeing Hobbiton)\n\nSome additional information: I do work in the aviation industry and I do have some quite good discounts on plane tickets. Unfortunately these advantages will stop after 6 months of unemployment so please disregard this in my choice of budget.\n\nI will be travelling solo as I want the full \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 experience. I have been working abroad in different destinations for a few years so although I haven\u2019t backpacked I know the vibe and what to be aware of.\n\nMy overall plan is to seek people out in airports, hostels, on excursions, at a job I might pick up etc in order to be social and feel like I am travelling with somebody. Just for me to feel safe but also because I am a very extroverted person. My biggest wish for this trip is to get loads of experiences and see wonderful things but an even bigger wish is to have people to share it with(and I don\u2019t mean people at home ofc). Overall outcome is I\u2019m hoping to have people along the way who will surf and skate and have fun with me.\n\nI would like to maybe once a month or as needed check in to maybe a nicer hotel than the hostels in order to get a day or two to myself.

On my submitted Evisa where it said intended place of residency I put in a town in Hanoi as that is where we were planning to spend most of our time. After some more planning we are going to land in Ho Chi Minh City first and then travel to Hanoi later. Upon some further research I realised that you are supposed to put your intended first place of stay. I was wondering if this would be an issue and should I apply for a new Visa as the one I applied for has already been granted?? Thanks",

        "selftext": "hello - i\u2019ll be heading to indonesia later this year and will hopping around Java and also fly to Lombok for around 10-12 days. I have done a good amount of traveling in the past, but usually don\u2019t hop around too much, so usually just have a suitcase. i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for backpacking bags that can replace my normal suitcase and backpack (and possibly hold a smaller backpack for when we go hiking)\n\nlooking for one that is able to fully unzip like a suitcase so it\u2019s easier to access clothes when staying in hostels and what not\n\n we plan to stay in both cities and random wilderness.\n\ni know nothing about backpacking, bag sizes, functionality, etc. so would love to hear people\u2019s opinions!\n",

I'm currently organizing a trip down to southeast Asia, this will be my first solo trip, and I'm committed to staying over for at least 6-9 months.

I'm a little worried about being an obvious tourist and would like to avoid confrontations as much as possible (had some experience with pickpockets in Paris). \n\nMy current trip will be 95% hostel stays, starting in Vietnam, then moving on to Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, India and finishing in Sri Lanka. I might have time to visit South Korea / Mongolia as well.\n\nI'll be spending about a month in each location and already looking into flights and visas.\n\nI'm in the process of purchasing some gear and mostly going off the guide here: [What to Take Backpacking - The Backpacking Site](https://www.the-backpacking-site.com/backpacking-travel-advice/backpacking/). \n\nI've already purchased a backpack (Osprey Farpoint 55L) and some trail shoes. I'm working my way up and already stuck on the socks. Darn Tough seem like the best option but there's limited styles and the cost is enormous for an Australian like me (3 pairs for almost $120). Oddly, they still beat out any Australian brand in function and cost. \n\nI'm very conscious of being prepared in most things and I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself to getting the right stuff for this trip.

For context, I want a good balance of hiking trails, cultural/historical sites, and good bars/nights out. I am well travelled around Europe but have never been to Asia. I will be flying from England.\n\nI don't want to create an in depth plan of everywhere I am going and when. I want to stay flexible so I can join up with others. However, I do want a general idea of the places I want to go and where to start. \n\nHere are the countries I 100% want to visit. I imagine it will take me around 3-4 months to visit these: \n\nVietnam,\nLaos,\nCambodia,\nThailand,\n\nThen I imagine I will be able to visit around 2-3 of these countries depending on time (I know not all of them are in SEA): \n\nMalaysia,\nIndonesia (I find Indonesia daunting as it is massive),\nSingapore (only for a few days, good for flights home),\nPhilippines,\nSri Lanka,\nNepal,\nChina (Yunnan or Hainan)\n\n\nHere are some of the rough routes/start points I am stuck deciding between: \n\n1. Hanoi, Vietnam start: From here I could head south to Cambodia, then north to Laos, then head south down Thailand (in a sort of zig zag route)\n\nI feel the main advantage of this is having dry weather in Vietnam when I land and I am most excited to visit Vietnam. I feel the main disadvantage is that the cultural shock could be more significant starting in Hanoi, than a more touristy city like Bangkok. \n\n2. Bangkok, Thailand start: From here I could do a loop around the rest of mainland SEA, either starting by heading north or east. Then I could return to Bangkok before going to see southern Thailand. \n\nI feel the main advantage of this route is it would be best for meeting other backpackers starting their journey. I feel the main disadvantage would be catching the end of the rainy season in Thailand. \n\n3. ???, Indonesia start: My final idea is starting in Indonesia. If I set off in late September/early October I could catch the end of the dry season in much of Indonesia. \n\nI feel the main disadvantage of this route is I wouldn't know where to start in Indonesia. Bali doesn't interest me much as I imagine it's like it's Ibiza in Asia. Although the potential hiking trails in Indonesia seem amazing. \n\nI would also be worried that if I started my trip off with a month in Indonesia by the time I got to northern Thailand, Vietnam and Laos I could get caught in the burning season. \n\n\nWould anyone be able to provide some advice on which start they feel suits me best?\n\nIs there a great starting point I have not thought of? \n\nAm I putting too much thought into this?? \n\nAll the best, Joe \n\n\n\n\n\n",

For context, I want a good balance of hiking trails, cultural/historical sites, and good bars/nights out. I am well travelled around Europe but have never been to Asia. I will be flying from England.\n\nI don't want to create an in depth plan of everywhere I am going and when. I want to stay flexible so I can join up with others. However, I do want a general idea of the places I want to go and where to start. \n\nHere are the countries I 100% want to visit. I imagine it will take me around 3-4 months to visit these: \n\nVietnam,\nLaos,\nCambodia,\nThailand,\n\nThen I imagine I will be able to visit around 2-3 of these countries depending on time (I know not all of them are in SEA): \n\nMalaysia,\nIndonesia (I find Indonesia daunting as it is massive),\nSingapore (only for a few days, good for flights home),\nPhilippines,\nSri Lanka,\nNepal,\nChina (Yunnan or Hainan)\n\n\nHere are some of the rough routes/start points I am stuck deciding between: \n\n1. Hanoi, Vietnam start: From here I could head south to Cambodia, then north to Laos, then head south down Thailand (in a sort of zig zag route)\n\nI feel the main advantage of this is having dry weather in Vietnam when I land and I am most excited to visit Vietnam. I feel the main disadvantage is that the cultural shock could be more significant starting in Hanoi, than a more touristy city like Bangkok. \n\n2. Bangkok, Thailand start: From here I could do a loop around the rest of mainland SEA, either starting by heading north or east. Then I could return to Bangkok before going to see southern Thailand. \n\nI feel the main advantage of this route is it would be best for meeting other backpackers starting their journey. I feel the main disadvantage would be catching the end of the rainy season in Thailand. \n\n3. ???, Indonesia start: My final idea is starting in Indonesia. If I set off in late September/early October I could catch the end of the dry season in much of Indonesia. \n\nI feel the main disadvantage of this route is I wouldn't know where to start in Indonesia. Bali doesn't interest me much as I imagine it's like it's Ibiza in Asia. Although the potential hiking trails in Indonesia seem amazing. \n\nI would also be worried that if I started my trip off with a month in Indonesia by the time I got to northern Thailand, Vietnam and Laos I could get caught in the burning season. \n\n\nWould anyone be able to provide some advice on which start they feel suits me best?\n\nIs there a great starting point I have not thought of? \n\nAm I putting too much thought into this?? \n\nAll the best, Joe \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,  we are planning a 2 week trip to Thailand! Would someone give me any advice on timing, making anything shorter or longer? Trip is in June. We are a married couple age 32. No kids. We like cultural sights, temples, good food, cute cafes, hip bars, rooftop bars, boats and other nature activities like snorkeling and hiking to view points. We don\u2019t like party vibes or loud areas at night, don\u2019t like luxury shopping and don\u2019t plan to buy a lot, and don\u2019t like too luxury expensive and don\u2019t like too budgety. Goal is hotels $50-100 USD per night. \n\nFly into Bangkok \n\nStay 4 nights - considering staying in Riverside nice hotel likely 3-4 stars. \n\nFly to Ko Samui \n\nStay 3 nights?? Considering staying in Fisherman village area rather than the Chaweng or Lamai areas which I\u2019ve heard are more party people. \n\nConsidering staying an additional* 2 nights in Ko Phangan or Ko Tao, or rather just staying all 5 nights in Samui and doing day trips only to those? Let me know what you think! We probably wanna snorkel or do an intro mini scuba but don\u2019t have time to do the full cert and could even do this on Phangan if you think - could maybe skip Tao? Or do both for one or more day each?\n\nFly to Chiang Mai \n\nStay 4 nights in Chiang Mai (elephant day trip, rather than overnight, but let me know if you have advice about this). Otherwise, we could do 5 nights here and take one night from the islands. We have no idea where to stay but I did hear the Chai Lai Elephant sanctuary would be a good one for a day trip and ethical. Maybe would stay in Chiang Mai Old Town??\n\nFly back to USA (in total 13 nights actually in Thailand) \n\nLet us know if you have any advice! ",

Whether it was kicking me out of the hotel or just kicking me out on the street.\n\nPakistan is somewhat similar to India and Bangladesh. I think, as Pakistanis often told me, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh all belong to the same South Asian system.\n\nOf course local people are very friendly too.\n\nBut dangers are always there. One day I was in a city, a mosque was attacked by a bomb, resulting in the deaths of over 200 police officers. Backpackers traveling to Pakistan should be careful.",

I\u2019m not worried about the weight or size for the flight as it is in the regulations I am just worried it might be a pain in the ass and as it is quite a big bag. Can anyone let me know if they had a bag of a similar size and if it was ok for you. Thanks (for reference here is a size 10 croc next to it) also I can not find this bag anywhere online despite trying so I can not tell you the size of Liters it is. ",

I would like to cross the border to china (khunjerab pass, which should be open from April?), because it's a country that's also really fascinating me. As a german I would have 30 days visa free (at least for this year) and would use this time to travel / hitchhike to the east coast.\n\nI just would like to hear some opinions on this rough plan, because it sounds amazing in my head but maybe it's just stupid dangerous.

I have a trip planned to Indonesia and I was planning to be there for nearly three months (83 days) . However, looking at visa requirements, I would require a visa-run outside of the country in order to continue the last 3 weeks. That would cost me about $150 CAD if I were to do a visa-run to Malaysia (return flight and visa included - IF I book my flight now) . \n\nThat being said, I had a flight already booked from Indonesia to Seoul on my way home (on day 83). But that flight has been cancelled and I have been given the option to (for free) : \n- either rebook for another day or \n- cancel the flight completely. \n\nThat came at a fortuitous time because now I'm conflicted. \n\n\nI've spoken to a few people who've been to Indonesia and they've told me 60 days was enough (I\u2019ve already spent a month in Lombok last year) and I've spoken to other people who are in Indonesia and they've told me that three months is not enough. I've already been to Malaysia (although I\u2019m open to returning - loved it there) I'm not interested in going to the Philippines or Sri Lanka or any of the surrounding countries and I've pretty much seen the rest of Southeast Asia. My question is, if you were me, what would you do? Would you cancel that flight to Seoul, leave Indonesia after 60 days, and stay in another country for 3 weeks before Seoul? Or would you do a visa-run and just rebook the flight to Seoul a day or 2 ahead ? (I already have a flight booked to go back to Canada fork Seoul about a 5 days later) \n\nAlso, where else would you go in Indonesia? My plan right now was : \n\n- to start in Jakarta (where my flight lands) \n- I want to go stargazing because apparently there's a really good clear sky at certain moments in certain places on Java. \n- And then I want to go hiking the two volcanoes that are in Java. (1 week) \n- And then I want to make my way to Bali for two weeks (exploring, meditation)\n-  and then the Gili Islands for 3 weeks (scuba diving) \n-  and then Lombok for one week (surfing) \n- and Suwalesi and Flores for the remaining weeks before I would fly back out from Jakarta. (Exploring)  \n\n\nNow, for that plan, is 2 months sufficient or will I want to come back to Indonesia after doing a visa-run or should I just go explore another surrounding country for those 3 weeks I would have left? Please bear in mind that I'm a solo female traveler who is reaching the end of her extended solo trip and my funds are now limited so I would rather do the most cost-effective option but also enjoy the last 3-4 weeks of my travels before I head back home to work. \n\nI really appreciate any feedback from those who\u2019ve been to Indonesia or are planning to. \n\nThanks so much ! I have 3 days to decide whether I want to rebook that flight to Seoulfor free or cancel it for free. \n\n(I\u2019ve also posted.  this in r/solotravel)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I have a dilemma and I was hoping you guys with experience will be able to help me out. I have a trip planned to Indonesia and I was planning to be there for nearly three months (83 days) . However, looking at visa requirements, I would require a visa-run outside of the country in order to continue the last 3 weeks. That would cost me about $150 CAD if I were to do a visa-run to Malaysia (return flight and visa included - IF I book my flight now) . \n\nThat being said, I had a flight already booked from Indonesia to Seoul on my way home (on day 83). But that flight has been cancelled and I have been given the option to (for free) : \n- either rebook for another day or \n- cancel the flight completely. \n\nThat came at a fortuitous time because now I'm conflicted. \n\n\nI've spoken to a few people who've been to Indonesia and they've told me 60 days was enough (I\u2019ve already spent a month in Lombok last year) and I've spoken to other people who are in Indonesia and they've told me that three months is not enough. I've already been to Malaysia (although I\u2019m open to returning - loved it there) I'm not interested in going to the Philippines or Sri Lanka or any of the surrounding countries and I've pretty much seen the rest of Southeast Asia. My question is, if you were me, what would you do? Would you cancel that flight to Seoul, leave Indonesia after 60 days, and stay in another country for 3 weeks before Seoul? Or would you do a visa-run and just rebook the flight to Seoul a day or 2 ahead ? (I already have a flight booked to go back to Canada fork Seoul about a 5 days later) \n\nAlso, where else would you go in Indonesia? My plan right now was : \n\n- to start in Jakarta (where my flight lands) \n- I want to go stargazing because apparently there's a really good clear sky at certain moments in certain places on Java. \n- And then I want to go hiking the two volcanoes that are in Java. (1 week) \n- And then I want to make my way to Bali for two weeks (exploring, meditation)\n-  and then the Gili Islands for 3 weeks (scuba diving) \n-  and then Lombok for one week (surfing) \n- and Suwalesi and Flores for the remaining weeks before I would fly back out from Jakarta. (Exploring)  \n\n\nNow, for that plan, is 2 months sufficient or will I want to come back to Indonesia after doing a visa-run or should I just go explore another surrounding country for those 3 weeks I would have left? Please bear in mind that I'm a solo female traveler who is reaching the end of her extended solo trip and my funds are now limited so I would rather do the most cost-effective option but also enjoy the last 3-4 weeks of my travels before I head back home to work. \n\nI really appreciate any feedback from those who\u2019ve been to Indonesia or are planning to. \n\nThanks so much ! I have 3 days to decide whether I want to rebook that flight to Seoulfor free or cancel it for free. \n\n(I\u2019ve also posted.  this in r/solotravel)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm heading to Japan for a 6-month exchange and planning to do weekend hikes all over the country \u2014 from Hokkaido in the north to the Japanese Alps and finishing in the south of Japan.\n\nIn August, I\u2019ll be doing a 3-week trek covering all these regions \u2014 starting in Hokkaido, passing through the Japanese Alps, and ending in the south. We\u2019ll mostly stick to trails, hiking around 10\u201315 km (6\u20139 miles) daily. Along the way, we plan to visit spots with summer festivals, traveling between regions by train and then hiking to nearby areas. I\u2019m also aware of the heat and humidity that comes with Japan\u2019s summer, so breathability is a big priority.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying on different hiking shoes, and I keep hearing that the best choice \"depends on your foot,\" but the problem is... they all feel equally good to me right now! I know the shoes I\u2019m considering are pretty different and designed for different purposes, but they each seem to offer benefits that could work for what I\u2019m planning to do. The options I\u2019m torn between are:\n\nHoka Speedgoat 6\n\nMerrell Moab 3\n\nLowa Fortux\n\n\nComfort and breathability are super important to me, especially since this will be my first long-distance trek. I\u2019ll also use the shoes for weekend hikes during the semester.\n\nIf you\u2019ve hiked in Japan during the summer or have experience with these shoes (or any other great options), I\u2019d love to hear your recommendations. Which would you pick, and why?\n\nThanks so much in advance! \ud83d\ude4f\n",

I know that once i\u2019ve landed safely, most my anxiety will go but i just feel horrible right now. it feels as though im potentially saying goodbye to my family and friends forever. Can someone please make me feel more sane and say that they had the exact same thoughts hahaha ",

We're not looking for guided tours per se, but is there something like a nature or survival course that could help us better understand the area before we head out into the wild?\n\nWe want to be as respectful as possible to the local culture and nature, so any advice from people who have experienced the terrain would be much appreciated! :)\n\nGreetings! \n\n",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm heading to Japan for a 6-month exchange and planning to do weekend hikes all over the country \u2014 from Hokkaido in the north to the Japanese Alps and finishing in the south of Japan.\n\nIn August, I\u2019ll be doing a 3-week trek covering all these regions \u2014 starting in Hokkaido, passing through the Japanese Alps, and ending in the south. We\u2019ll mostly stick to trails, hiking around 10\u201315 km (6\u20139 miles) daily. Along the way, we plan to visit spots with summer festivals, traveling between regions by train and then hiking to nearby areas. I\u2019m also aware of the heat and humidity that comes with Japan\u2019s summer, so breathability is a big priority.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying on different hiking shoes, and I keep hearing that the best choice \"depends on your foot,\" but the problem is... they all feel equally good to me right now! I know the shoes I\u2019m considering are pretty different and designed for different purposes, but they each seem to offer benefits that could work for what I\u2019m planning to do. The options I\u2019m torn between are:\n\nHoka Speedgoat 6\n\nMerrell Moab 3\n\nLowa Fortux\n\n\nComfort and breathability are super important to me, especially since this will be my first long-distance trek. I\u2019ll also use the shoes for weekend hikes during the semester.\n\nIf you\u2019ve hiked in Japan during the summer or have experience with these shoes (or any other great options), I\u2019d love to hear your recommendations. Which would you pick, and why?\n\nThanks so much in advance! \ud83d\ude4f\n",

        "selftext": "Hi, I currently own trusty 25L backpack from decathlon for daily hikes but sometimes I would like to have longer trips 1-3 nights or few weeks long world travel where I love to walk or light hike.\n\nSince I live in europe, it does not seem that I will want to carry a tent due to local restrictions. Most likely I will just carry sleeping bag or not at all and sleep in hostels.\n\nThis year i am going for 2 weeks in india (mostly trains, hotels, walking from temple to temple)\n\nNext year I have planned camino de santiago (2 weeks, hostels)\n\nIn few years I plan to visit south america in similar fashion as India this year.\n\n  \nAm I right to think that 40-45L will be sufficient for person like me? I was thinking of getting the widely recommended Atmos AG 65 or Baltoro 65 but i think it works great only if you carry full sleep system everytime with you.\n\nOnce a year me and my gf like to go for tent camping in italy so it would be great If the backpack was able to fit 2-3 person tent (\\~60cm?) and items for 4-5 stationary camping days but once I set up my tent, I want to grab my comfy backpack and explore nature/towns around with comfort. \n\n  \nTell me if i overthink or think stupid but I just ordered Atmos 65L and the more i look at it, the more i think that it will be too much for my needs - but I am a newbie and would like some guidance or backpack recommendations.  \n",

Based on historical weather looks like the mean daily temperature will be hovering around 0 Celcius but in cold snaps the average daily temperature can get to -5C and minimums for the area can get down to -10 - -15 (Althorp gh I imagine that would be mostly at night). I'm from a subtropical country and have never been anywhere so cold so looking for some opinions. I've got a Kathmandu down jacket (550 fill power approx 150g fill) that I can pair with a heavy weight fleece and thermals, but wondering if that would be warm enough in those temps. I'm currently looking at the Kathmandu winterburn down parka (600 fill 250g duck down/feathers) or the Patagonia downdrift parka (600 fill power, fill weight not specified). The hiking I will be doing will be easy to moderate and I definitely run cold so wanting to make sure I'm nice and warm. I also leave very soon so won't have time to order in any international brands so that or other brands available in Australia is what I'm limited to. Any thoughts or advice appreciated :)",

On the other hand, it IS just some simple angle aluminum, aluminum extrusions, brackets, and connecting hardware....is it possible that this is good enough quality to be functional and reliable at this price point?  \n  \nBased on the listing, and the fact that there are a half dozen identical listings from different sellers, I assume it's something factory-direct out of China, but I'm still curious.  \n\nReally hoping someone else has already bitten the bullet on this one and can tell me if it turned out to be worth it or not. \n\n(And I know this isn't compatible with the Extended Transit; I'm planning to have my vent fan at the very rear over the bed though, so I don't actually need the roof rack to extend that far, especially if it's this much cheaper than the competitors.)\n\nThoughts? \n\n",

My plan is to drive up the east coast to the northern tip of Hokkaido then return along the west coast. I want to take my time, stop at random places, maybe visit some islands, and not feel rushed so I don\u2019t have a strict itinerary. I figure this trip will take around 2 to 3 weeks?\n\n\n\n***Car Rental Questions***\n\nThis will be my first time renting a car. I\u2019d love to avoid locking in a strict return date. Are there rental options that let you pay as you go or refund unused days if I return it early? Or is booking a fixed period my only option?\n\nI\u2019ve seen Skyscanner recommended for car rentals. \n\nI should get a car with an ETC card to pay tolls at the end of my trip. Any other must-have features for a rental?\n\n\n\n***Navigation and Payment***\n\nI\u2019ve heard driving in Japan is fairly straightforward. I plan to use Google Maps for navigation. Or are there better options?\n\nI\u2019ll mostly use my credit card and SUICA but I\u2019m thinking of exchanging $200 in cash just in case. Would that be enough for cash-only places?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what comes to mind, any road trip tips, rental advice, must-visit spots, things to watch out for, experiences or suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",

Outside of acorns and finding blackberries in the wild (Eglin), I'm pretty much lost.\n\nI think that's why I like the semi-grid.\n\nClose enough to civilization to not die. Even better a small patch of trees right in the middle of the grid and I'm fine.\n\n...\n\nI stopped by my new favorite dumpster this morning and snagged a pear, another raw potatoes, two tangerines and an apple. I ate a couple of strawberries while I gathered my treasure.\n\nAround 2 pm my stomach started growling. I had a couple of options. Panhandle at McDonald's or do a bit of urban foraging.\n\nBefore I went on my expedition I stopped by old faithful. Yesterday's fruit was already turning. Grabbed some asparagus and went on my way.\n\nAlthough I was extremely hungry, I was probably getting more nutrients these last two days than I had the entire time I was in Texas. I ate good in TX. But fruit and veggies were sparse.\n\n....\n\nI found an Asian market that must sell soups and dinners. Ate about two handfuls of noodles (tasty), but started to smell something. It wasn't the noodles, but something awful was in the air.\n\nHeaded down the road and saw a gas station. Inside the organic, residential type can was a ton of hot dogs and other gas station food. Intermixed with coffee grounds. Tried a bite of the hot dog. It just didn't taste good enough to warrant the risk. I literally couldn't tell how long that stuff was there.\n\nKept trekking.\n\nI found a Mexican restaurant and ate about four of the smallest bananas I've ever seen. Someone in the comments will hip me to what I actually ate. I'm sure it has a name besides tiny bananas. Grabbed three small cucumbers and was feeling good about the hunt.\n\nI'm not sure how far I had walked, but the complexion of the businesses change.\n\nNot that way.\n\nI mean no restaurants, grocery stores or other places that sold food.\n\nI finally see a gas station.\n\nI was caught immediately.\n\nMy hand wasn't in the cookie jar. My grasp was around a sandwich still in the original container.\n\n\"I'm hungry.\"\n\nThat was my only response to his three objections.\n\n\"I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"Please sir. I'm hungry.\"\n\n....\n\nI had no intention of arguing. I just wasn't letting go of that sandwich or that bag I had resting on the lip of the 8 yd dumpster.\n\n....\n\nIt finally sunk in. The store owner told me that the sandwiches were expired. I assured him I wouldn't sue him.\n\n\"I'm just hungry.\"\n\nI was.\n\nHe let me know that I need to ask in the future. I said I would. I meant it.\n\nI only took three sandwiches but he was more than happy to let me know there were quite a few more.\n\nWe all speak the same language.\n\nOn a base level.\n\nI ate the tuna fish sandwich on whole grain bread first.\n\nSolid choice.\n\nThat was my biggest risk. When mayo turns it can get ugly.\n\nNext on the menu was turkey and pesto.\n\nAnother solid choice.\n\nI will have to look up pesto later. Is that cheese or the green stuff on the bread?\n\nDoesn't matter.\n\nLastly I was eating the ham and cheddar.\n\nOriginally, I thought that would be the safe bet. Italian style bread. Ham. Cheddar.\n\nIt should have been called ham and cheese whiz.\n\nI'm already grossing myself out eating cheese whiz. Not that hungry anymore.\n\nNext thing I know I'm thinking about the hot dog in coffee grounds.\n\nI started dry heaving.\n\nImmediately threw the rest of that sandwich in a trash receptacle and dry heaved about four more times.\n\nIn my head.\n\nFuck.\n\nThese idiots know Reddit will blame the raw potatoes.\n\nI wasn't exactly sure if I was sick or not.\n\nNope.\n\nI've got a weak stomach.\n\nI know.\n\nA dumpster diving bum with a weak stomach?\n\nYep.\n\nI'm back at the library now using their internet.\n\nSince I didn't actually vomit, I'll chalk up today to having a weak stomach and thinking about something I shouldn't have been thinking about.",

This money is making a\u00a0[huge difference](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_0GT2hNf2HLZuHb8SYhAZWTnlfao-Z-_/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=110032385833453069686&rtpof=true&sd=true)\u00a0in the lives of\u00a0[underprivileged children](https://www.facebook.com/ThanhLocProject?mibextid=ZbWKwL)\u00a0and\u00a0[trafficked people\u00a0](https://www.bluedragon.org/)\u00a0in Vietnam.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nStarting in early 2025, I will be embarking on another incredible adventure.\n\nSetting off from the very top of Ireland I will cycle and hike around Europe ([here\u2019s a rough map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KxILIbHQzrsVmxMdvfaiYQyHFGCySZyI/view?usp=sharing)) including the north of Spain, southern France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia and much more\u2026\n\nI will be raising money for\u00a0[Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.ie/)\u00a0and raising awareness of the work they are doing in many areas including\u00a0[protecting refugees](https://www.amnesty.ie/i-welcome-refugees-reports/),\u00a0[campaigning against torture](https://www.amnesty.ie/what-we-do/stop-torture/), and\u00a0[abolishing the death penalty](https://www.amnesty.ie/what-we-do/abolish-death-penalty/).\n\nWhy I Need You\n\nBuilding on my experience in Vietnam, I realize I need a dedicated team to maximize our impact. To this end I need two enthusiastic and experienced people: a videographer/photographer and a social media specialist.\u00a0\n\nThe videographer will capture the essence of the journey, and the social media specialist will be able to quickly and effectively edit these moments into a regular video update in order to keep people engaged (and donating to the cause!). I\u2019m aware that our socials lacked variety and that was a weak area in Vietnam, which is why I\u2019m reaching out to people who will bring their skills to this walk and help ensure it becomes a huge success.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a professional - passion and experience are enough! - and in addition to your technical proficiency, you\u2019ll need to have certain other qualities:\n\nNecessary:\n\n1. A moderate-to-high level of fitness. Although we won't be breaking any world records on our European adventure, we will be hiking or cycling 90% of the days and this includes mountains and a range of weather conditions from the depths of winter in the north of Ireland to the height of summer in eastern Europe.\n2. The craic (fun-loving). While we are aiming to do some serious good in the world with this challenge, the fact is that in order to function cohesively as a group over prolonged periods, we need to get along. All members of the team need to be friends and feel like they can communicate whatever they need to, and work together to avoid conflict. Having fun together is a vital part of being an effective team.\n3. A genuine passion for helping people less fortunate than ourselves.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nIf you feel like you fit the bill, please DM me here or email me at:\n\n\u00a0[dibocharity@gmail.com](mailto:dibocharity@gmail.com)\n\nOr if you know anyone who might be a great match, please pass this on to them.\n\nSean",

        "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nMy friend and I are gearing up for an epic 40-day adventure in Panama and Costa Rica at the end of January. We've got a serious case of wanderlust and are eager to dive into the heart of Central America.\n\nBefore this, we embarked on a thrilling two-month escapade in Thailand earlier this year. Our journey started in bustling Bangkok, where we found a home in the heart of Chinatown. Little did we know that we'd make a lifelong friend there. He was the owner of a charming restaurant, keeping alive a cherished family tradition passed down through generations. At the age of 70-80, he had some incredible stories to share.\n\nFrom Bangkok, we headed to the  Sai Yok National Park, where we spent three  nights surrounded by nature's wonders. We then hit the road, renting a car in Kanchanaburi, and spent nearly 20 days exploring the enchanting north of Thailand. It was a wild ride with numerous national parks, quirky villages, encounters with exotic animals, and some mind-bogglingly adventurous roads.\n\nBut the adventure didn't stop there. In Phuket, we hopped on scooters and embarked on a 100-kilometer journey north to catch a speedboat to the stunning Similan Islands. We decided to be rebels and forgo helmets, opting for the freedom of the open road. Little did we know what awaited us.\n\nAfter a full day of adventure, we joined the rest of the travelers who had opted for vans and jeeps to return. However, we were determined to relish the scooter ride back. Just when we thought our journey couldn't get more exhilarating, the heavens opened up, and the rain poured down in buckets. With no choice but to seek shelter, we pulled into a house's garden, where we waited for the rain to subside.\n\nAs the rain finally let up, we decided to brave the road once more, our clothes drenched and spirits undeterred. Our 100-kilometer journey back home turned into an unforgettable rain-soaked adventure that left us with a tale to tell.\n\nOur journey then led us south to Pattaya, Phuket, the Similan Islands, and Krabi. It was two months filled with breathtaking sights and unforgettable memories, a whirlwind of adventure and discovery.\n\nWe're always on the lookout for the offbeat, the untouched, and the wild side of travel. Nature has a special place in our hearts, and we're eager to immerse ourselves in the natural beauty of Panama and Costa Rica.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or recommendations for our upcoming trip, we'd be incredibly grateful. Sharing experiences and insights with fellow travelers is what makes these adventures even more enriching.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",
